Washington Heritage Trail.  ,  The Washington Heritage Trail is a 136-mile national scenic byway inspired by the prominent footsteps of George Washington through the three historic counties of West Virginia�s Eastern Panhandle. Compelling history, spectacular scenery, geologic wonders, recreation and year �round activities and festivals are highlighted by 45 historical sites. The trail meanders across mountains and rivers, through forests, farms and orchards as it connects five 18th century towns that remain the center of life today and offer comfortable lodging, unique shopping and fine dining. More information on attractions and services throughout the area is available at each town�s Visitor Center. , <b>Paw Paw.</b> Paw Paw is the westernmost settlement in Morgan County, incorporated as a town on April 8, 1891. A former canal, railroad, orchard and tannery boomtown, Paw Paw is embraced by one of the bends of the Potomac River. Colonial travelers heading west, including George Washington, often forded the river or crossed the gap in the mountain here. In 1928 a bridge replaced the pre-Civil War ferry. Braddock�s French and Indian War army camped south of town, a site used in the Civil War as the federal Camp Chase. The B&O Railroad arrived in 1838; by the 1930s, six trains per day stopped at the depot. Passenger service ceased in 1961. The Paw Paw Pullman car was dedicated on April 16, 1948 and assigned to the Capitol Limited route from Washington, DC to Chicago. , <b>Paw Paw Tunnel.</b> Beginning in 1836, the C&O Canal Company took 14 years to carve a 3118-foot tunnel through Sorrell Ridge, eliminating 6 miles of river bends. The Paw Paw Tunnel was dubbed by American promoters as a wonder of the world. At 24 feet high, it is the largest manmade structure on the C&O Canal and is lined with more than 6 million bricks. A mile north of town, the restored towpath is part of the C&O Canal National Park and welcomes cyclists and hikers year �round. , <b>The Fruit.</b> The town is named for the fruit that grows along the river and ridge. Found throughout the United States, the paw paw is North America�s largest native edible fruit with purplish-brown flowers in April and ripe fruit in September. A natural custard, it was a favorite dessert of George Washington. ,   <blockquote><i>��our party entirely out of provisions�perfectly contented and tell us they can live very well on the pappaws�� , Sep. 18,1806 William Clark; Lewis and Clark expedition.</i></blockquote>"},{"id":459,"title":"W.

The statue before you was created as a tribute to the pioneer women who braved the uncertainties of the great journey west. The Madonna memorials were a project of the Daughters of the American Revolution and were dedicated between 1926 and 1929. The monument was conceived by Arlene B. Moss of St. Louis, Missouri and sculpted by August Leimbach. Earlier plans included the idea of placing over 3000 mile markers along the entire length of U.S. 40. By 1924, the plans had evolved to that of placing a single monument in each of the states through were the road passed.  , A total of 12 statues were placed along the route of the National Road. At that time, the route known as the National Road was a transcontinental highway, sometimes called the National Old Trails Road. It included the original section of federal highway, identified today as he Historic National Road, and the later extensions encompassed in what we know today as U.S. 40. , This specific monument was dedicated on July 7th, 1926, the first being in Ohio just 3 days earlier on July 4th. The work of creating and placing the statues was done in cooperation with the National Old Trails Road Association. The Association, with its president, Harry S. Truman, later U.S. President, provided for the cost of erecting the monuments. , All of the Madonnas are identical. They were cast in an amalgam of crushed granite, stone, cement and lead ore known as �algonite�. A primary ingredient was a pinkish Missouri granite. , The statue is 10 feet tall and sits on a 6 foot base. An additional 2 foot foundation makes the monument 18 feet tall, weighing over 17 tons. , Dedication inscriptions are carved into the base. The text on the inscriptions varies with the site. , The original National Road extended from Cumberland, MD to Vandalia, IL. Often referred to as the Cumberland Road, it was constructed between 1811 and 1839, with an interruption in work due to the War of 18 12. The road reached Wheeling in 1818. In 2002, the original road, with the addition of sections from Baltimore to Cumberland, MD and from Vandalia to East St. Louis, IL, was designated as an All American Road.

Historic National Road.  , In 1816, with a strong interest in internal improvements, the legislatures of Virginia and Ohio authorized the formation of the Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company (Belmont because the bridge company was to connect from Wheeling, Virginia to Belmont County in Ohio). With the coming of the National Road to Wheeling, it was necessary to bridge the Ohio. Although the road reached Wheeling in 1818, it wasn't until 1847 that the construction of a bridge was commissioned. In sharp competition with John Roebling, later noted for the famous Brooklyn Bridge, the company granted the contract to Charles Ellet, Jr.  , The span of the bridge is 1010 feet, measured from the center of the two supporting towers, the longest clear-span bridge in the world at the time. All the materials for the bridge , including the drawn iron wire used to create the cables, were produced locally. The main cables rest upon iron rollers at the summits of each tower. The rollers relieve the strain on the cables caused by expansion and contraction with the changes in temperature. , In 1854, high winds set up an ocillation in the deck structure that resulted in severe damage to the bridge. Under the supervision of Ellet, reconstruction work began almost immediately and the bridge was reopened in just three months. In 1867 the Citizen Railway Company was granted permission to lay tracks on the bridge to accommodate horse-drawn streetcars, a possibility indicated earlier by Ellet. In 1872, Washington Roebling, son of John Roebling, was commissioned to provide upgrades to the bridge which included the installation of diagonal cable stays. The bridge remained essentially unchanged until 1956 when a new steel deck system was installed. , The most recent work on the bridge was completed in 1999 with repairs to the stiffening truss and wire rope stays, complete inspection and rewrapping of the cables, and the installation of new illumination. Today, the bridge stands as one of the finest example of pre-Civil War engineering and is considered as one of the world's most significant and historic bridges. , <i>(left sidebar)</i> Charles Ellet, Jr., was born in 1810 in Bucks County, near Philadelphia. The young Ellet had little interest in farming and in 1827 left home to join a survey of the Susquehanna River. In 1828 he gained employment on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and rose to the position of assistant engineer by 1829. The following year Ellet resigned and moved to France to study. Returning to the U.S. in 1832, Ellet became a leading proponent of wire suspension bridge construction. In 1841, he won the contract to build the Fairmount Bridge across the Schuykill River at Philadelphia. This placed Ellet in the forefront of wire suspension bridge construction in America, a position further enhanced with the building of the Wheeling Suspension Bridge. ,   ,  <i>(right sidebar)</i> On November 10, 1849, just five days before the official opening of the bridge, the water level at the bridge rose 20 feet. The steamboat, Messenger, on its way upstream to Pittsburgh, had to cut almost 8 feet from her smoke stacks to pass under the bridge. The following day the Hibernia #2 was likewise impaired but waited for the water level to drop before continuing upstream. Armed with these and similar events, the State of Pennsylvania, on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh, filed a case in federal court to either have the bridge removed or elevated, the argument being that it was an obstruction to river traffic. In May of 1852, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in favor of Pennsylvania. The bridge either had to be elevated or removed by February 1, 1853. The battle for the bridge moved to Congress. The Bridge Company successfully lobbied the House Committee of Post Office and Post Roads to have the bridge designated as a post and military road. By the end of August 1852, the House passed legislation legalizing the bridge and thus fixing its height and location. Finally, in 1856, after another legal challenge to the bridge by Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court recognized the Congressional action and ruled in favor of the bridge. Of course, by this time the height of the bridge was largely irrelevant since most steamboats had hinged stacks that could be lowered to pass under bridges."},{"id":729,"title":"State�s Birthplace","pos":[40.05584,-80.66933],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=729","desc":"State�s Birthplace. .  , West Virginia was organized in 1861 at Washington Hall, 12th and Market streets.

Island Park was a well known tourist attraction at that time, with a steam driven merry-go-round and ferris wheel, dance pavilions, midway, wading beaches, boat rentals, and picnic areas. Gilbert Perry, a town resident, was quoted in 1880: \"Island Park is every bit as gay as Coney Island.\" The B&O ran excursions from Baltimore and Washington, DC for $1.00, offering post Civil War city dwellers a means of escaping the city summer heat to socialize and recreate in a wonderful natural and historic surrounding. , After years of flood repairs, the B&O Railroad ceased operating the amusement park in 1909, but kept the park open for picnicking.

Unable to move their artillery and supply wagons forward due to poor road conditions, Confederate forces fell back towards General Early in the Shenandoah Valley on January 7th, failing to take the garrison. On January 30th, Confederate forces attacked and captured 80 Union supply wagons en route for Petersburg. Colonel Thoburn, knowing that his supplies were exhausted and learning of the impending attack, evacuated the Fort after midnight.

It is approximately 700 feet east to west and 400 feet north to south at its widest point.

You are standing between two bombproofs and directly in front of you is a third, much larger. The remains of a fourth exists to the left. These structures were covered with logs and a layer of earth that would have stopped opposing artillery fire. These are the structures that were destroyed by Confederate General Jubal Early�s forces in January of 1864, after Federal troops had abandoned the post. General Early stated that his men &#8220;demolished the works, which contained several bombproof shelters for men, and magazines for ammunition and other stores.&#8221; ,  Fort Mulligan was used as a forward post and auxiliary depot to supply Union troops on their expeditions against Confederate forces. Almost all supplies came 38 miles by wagon train from the railroad at New Creek Station (Keyser). These trains, the mail, couriers and scouting patrols were all subject to attack by the McNeill Rangers or other Confederate groups. Only forage for horses was gathered locally, with garrison troops forced to go as far as 15 miles to gather it. ,   <blockquote> <b>From the Letters of Joshua Winters, January 9th, 1864.</b> ,  <i>&#8220;Dear sister, it is with plazer that i seat miself this eaving to answer your letter. i wood of writtin sooner but the mail didant go from hear for a fue days. .... well i suppose you hurd of the wagon train a bein taken betwean hearand New Crick. thay got sum of the gards that was on the train but i gess thay onley got one or to of our regment. the rest got away. i gess thay was a lettel excited about the rail rode. thay thout the rebs was a goin to try it again. we was a lookin for them hear but thay didant trubel us. thay was betwean hear and New Crick. we coodant hear from New Crick a tall. we packed up and loud to leve hear the morning of the 6 at three in the morning. we had every ting reddy to burn when thair was a dispach cum to stay hear. we had destroid a good deal of grub before the order com. we thout we was a goin to git to leve hear but we was disapinted. i gess the rebs is all gone back and the scare is over. ... i was on pickit last night and am to sleepy to write mutch today. ... i will write soon a gain. giv mi love to all. no more from your brother, Joshua Winters.&#8221;</i> </blockquote>"},{"id":14536,"title":"The Impregnable Fortress","pos":[39.00083,-79.14083],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=14536","desc":"The Impregnable Fortress. .  ,  You are now at the western end of Fort Mulligan. The acute angles at this end of the works were clearly designed to be occupied by several artillery pieces to fend off attacks from the Seneca Road and the ravine to the southwest. ,  Fort Mulligan was built to be an impregnable fortress. The inner walls of the Fort were lined with timber and a defensive barrier of cut trees, known as an abatis, protruded from the outer entrenchment walls to prevent a major assault. There are indications of as many as three entrances and at least seven gun emplacements. ,  It�s not hard to picture the incredible amount of work that was done here. Construction of the dirt earthworks was most likely done almost entirely with picks and shovels, with horses\t dragging in logs and perhaps hauling some earth in wagons. Hundreds and perhaps, at times, over a thousand men labored here for weeks on end. Some companies would work on the Fort while other companies were on picket duty and guard duty.

As a result, Armory officials took a stand that public houses, such as White Hall Tavern, ruined morals, work ethics, and even threatened armory production.

The Fairmont and Mannington Home Guards, with detachments from the 13th Pennsylvania Cavalry, 23rd Illinois Infantry, 106th New York Infantry, and 6th West Virginia Infantry, opposed them. John Coffman, Jr., of Harrison County, was among the Federals killed, and Perry Watton of Palatine was wounded. ,  After capturing the foundry, the Confederates rode upstream to the railroad bridge.

To your left, a block away, are abutments of the suspension bridge that spanned the Monongahela River, joining Fairmont and Palatine. Across the river in Palatine, part of the garrison (including Fleming) was stationed in the foundry to protect the eastern ends of this bridge and the railroad bridge upstream. The Federals had removed the suspension bridge�s floorboards to prevent the Confederates from crossing. ,  Jones divided his command, sending his main column in Fairmont upriver to the railroad bridge while a detachment fought its way across the suspension bridge, laying found timbers for flooring as they went. The Confederates secured both bridges and captured many Federals, including those in the foundry. A train bearing Union reinforcements arrived from Grafton but was driven away from the rail bridge, which Jones destroyed. He also paroled the prisoners before leaving for Bridgeport. He reported three men wounded and left in the care of &#8220;kind friends.&#8221; ,  Fleming was promoted to captain by the Paw Paw militia for his service during the raid.

The turnpike crossed Rich Mountain through the notch to the left of the radio towers., After the defeat at Philippi on June 3 in the \"First Land Battle of the Civil War,\" the Confederates reorganized at Huttonsville under Gen.

On Rich Mountain and Laurel Hill, Garnett fortified the passes that he called \"the gates to the Northwestern country.\" Union forces routed the Confederates on Rich Mountain on July 11, and the next day McClellan occupied Beverly. This area remained in Federal hands for the rest of the war., Garnett became the first general killed in the Civil War, at Corrick's Ford (near present-day Parsons) on July 13. Gen. Robert E. Lee came to this area in August and established a headquarters at Valley Mountain but failed to drive out the Federals., These small Union triumphs had two important outcomes. First, President Abraham Lincoln promoted the victorious McClellan to command all Union armies after the shocking Federal defeat at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21. Second, Federal control here allowed the fledgling statehood movement to grow.

At the time of the Civil War, the South Branch Valley was comprised of many small, independent farms. The mid-19th century was a golden age of agriculture in the eastern United States, and the valley was among the most agriculturally productive areas in Virginia. With the coming of war the valley found itself part of the newly created northern state of West Virginia. However sympathies of the people of the valley were mostly with Virginia and the South, and many of their husbands and sons served with Confederate units., Romney and the South Branch Valley held strategic significance because of their proximity to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The B and O Railroad was a vital transportation link for the North, linking the eastern and western states. Throughout the war, Confederates fought to disrupt traffic on the B and O Railroad. By controlling Romney and the South Branch Potomac Valley, the North could protect a critical stretch of railroad from Confederate raids., Union troops under the command of Colonel Jacob M. Campbell were ordered to Romney in early March, 1863. Col.

There is no evidence of a magazine or any other structure having been located within the redoubt., A redoubt is a small enclosed earthwork used to fortify a position from attacks on all sides. The square is the most common form for a redoubt in part due to the ease with which it is constructed. The weakest point of a square redoubt is the corner, or <i>salient</i>, as only a limited amount of fire can be concentrated in that direction. The corner projections, or <i>traverses</i>, of the central redoubt are intended to help overcome that weakness. With these projections, the redoubt has the form of a miniature bastion fort., The central redoubt is specifically positioned along the crest of the ridge to dominate the gap in Mill Creek Mountain to the west. The east side of the redoubt dominates the river valley, while the south side defends against potential Confederate infantry attack down the ridgeline from the south.

Crossing the Mountains. Early in the 1800s, growing western settlement spured a push to improve transportation routes over the Appalachian Mountains. In 1822, Virginia authorized a survey of the route that became the Staunton to Parkersburg Turnpike. Connecting the upper Shenandoah Valley with the Ohio River, the turnpike was funded primarily by state funds, with contributions from communities along the right-of-way. The general route followed earlier Native American and game trails, which by 1790 had often been improved into rough roads. Turnpike construction began in 1838 from both ends of the Pike and the middle section was completed in 1845., The Turnpike was to be built on a variation of the macadam plan, a paving system calling for an elevated road surface with several layers of small stones combined to make a watertight surface. Construction was contracted out in sections. In reality, only some sections of the Turnpike were ever completed to specifications. Once opened, occasional appropriations and the tolls collected proved inadequate to finish bridges and to maintain the roadway., Even so, the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike provided access for settlement and trade into the western sections of Virginia. It was a valued prize fought over during the Civil War. Following the War, most of the turnpike ran within the new state of West Virginia. The road was repaired slowly, and tolls continued to be collected in some sections up to the 1890s., Virginia chief engineer, Claudius Crozet described the route as a \"sea of mountains and valleys with little level land\" and rivers \"flowing in every direction of the compass.\", Most of the route of the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike can be followed today on modern roadways. Within West Virginia, the route from here to Parkersburg has been designated as the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike Byway. Some sections of the original route that have been bypassed by the modern highway are designated as Backway routes."},{"id":32889,"title":"The First Campaign","pos":[38.47551,-79.69911],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=32889","desc":"The First Campaign. Civil War Begins in the Mountains of (West) Virginia. West Virginia, born of a nation divided, was the setting for the first campaign of America's Civil War. Although still part of Virginia in 1861, many citizens of the west remained loyal to the Union, rather than the Confederacy. By late May, Union General George B. McClellan, commanding the Department of the Ohio, launched the first campaign, ordering troops to cross the Ohio River and secure \"Western\" Virginia for the Union., Here, during June-July 1861, McClellan's army won the inaugural Union victories of the Civil War. Hailed as the North's first battlefield hero, McClellan was summoned to Washington on July 22, following a stunning Union debacle at Manassas, Virginia. Federal troops now occupied Western Virginia, as loyal delegates met in Wheeling to form the \"Restored Government of Virginia,\" a Union government to oppose the Confederate one in Richmond., By August 1861, Southern forces again threatened. Confederate General Robert E. Lee attempted to reclaim Western Virginia, but failed miserably. Troops of both armies remained to guard the mountain passes during that terrible winter. By 1862, conflict shifted east. The first campaign proved to be decisive: the western counties under Union control became the new state of West Virginia in 1863. The arduous conflict in these mountains forged armies and leaders-notably McClellan, Lee, and Stonewall Jackson - who shaped the course of the Civil War., <i>\"The history of that remarkable campaign would show, if truly portrayed, a degree of severity, of hardship, of toil, of exposure and suffering that finds no parallel.\"</i> , Col.

This routine was disturbed on December 13, 1861 as 1,900 Federal soldiers under General Robert H. Milroy attacked the position. Poor timing by the Union troops helped the 1,200 Confederate defenders to turn back each assault separately. Throughout the action the Confederates were able to outnumber the attacking troops. The engagement was a confused affair. Advantage ebbed and flowed during the roughly seven hours of fighting. Finally the Federal forces withdrew to Cheat Summit Fort. The Federals suffered approximately 137 casualties and the Confederates roughly 146., <b>The Winter of 1861-62</b> , After the battle, life returned to the ofttimes dull routine of service in a remote outpost. The winter was a severe one. Measles, pneumonia, and other diseases caused many deaths among the troops posted here. The Confederates abandoned Camp Allegheny in April of 1862. Supply difficulties as well as camp conditions contributed to the decision to leave.

During the Civil War the bridge served both North and South in passage of troops and supplies across the mountains into Virginia. Several times the bridge narrowly missed the fate of many other wooden structures along the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike that were burned., The dual-lane structure was made of yellow poplar. Masonry work used native stone; and iron bolts, the only metal used, were made by local blacksmiths., When modern traffic loads were too much for wooden floor beams, officials constructed hearings to decide whether to repair or replace the span. In 1938 the bridge received two additional piers, a steel reinforced concrete floor, and a walkway to handle more safely the increased demands of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. This brought the bridge's weight capacity to ten tons., Following the fire in 1989, the $1.4 million project, using as much of the original material as possible, restored the structure to its original appearance. Additions of lighting and a sprinkler system have not detracted from the authenticity., For the Civil War buff crossing the bridge you enter the gateway to the upper Tygart Valley and on to the eastern theater of the War., On February 14, 1844, Philippi was established by the General Assembly of Virginia.

You are standing less than a mile from an important battle site in the Civil War. Just ahead a handful of determined Union troops and townspeople would thwart the Confederate Raiders. , Though small in scale compared to Gettysburg and Antietam, the struggle to control the B&O Railroad was pivotal in Lincoln's war plan. On April 26, 1863, a force of 1500 Confederates attacked Rowlesburg and tried to destroy the two key bridges crossing Cheat Valley. Had they been successful, the link between the Army of the Potomac and the Ohio, Indiana and Illinois Volunteers would have been cut for perhaps the duration of the war., Not only were the B&O Railroad bridges in Rowlesburg famous around the world and an inspiration to writers and artists, but they also came early to the attention of those planning the Confederate strategy in the War Between the States. As the Confederates planned to destroy the Rowlesburg brides, the Federals hurried to protect them. Robert E. Lee would say that to destroy the Cheat River Bridge would be \"worth to him an army.\" To the Federal side preserving \"Lincoln's Lifeline\" was of equal importance., To help defend the railroad bridges in Rowlesburg General George McClellan ordered the Sixteenth Ohio Regiment to be sent by train to reinforce existing troops. This was the beginning of the buildup of the Rowlesburg garrison and recognition of the strategic importance of the little river town in the Civil War. Historian Mike Workman completed a definitive study of Rowlesburg in the Civil War. The account that follows of the attack on Rowlesburg is based upon Dr. Workman's study., After the initial threat posed by General Garrett's unsuccessful move toward Rowlesburg in 1861, the Rowlesburg garrison was gradually reduced to about 300 men under the command of Major John Showalter. Confederate General, W.E. Jones, who was known by the nickname of \"Grumble\" for his irascible temper and profanity-laced tirades, would lead the 1500 Confederate cavalry, known as \"Jones' Raiders.\" On April 26, 1863, General Jones and his cavalry rode from Red House, Maryland to the foot of Cheat Mountain on the old Northwestern Turnpike, now US 50. Jones' party was the northern prong of the famous Jones-Imboden Raid. Just the day before they had defeated as garrison of Union troops defending the passage through Greenleaf Gap., Jones chose a two-part maneuver at the Cheat River Bridge, the wood double span covered bridge crossing the Cheat River about five miles south of Rowlesburg. Jones would send a small dismounted force of less than 100 men up over Palmer's Knob to descend into Rowlesburg and torch the B&O Railroad Bridge crossing Cheat River in the middle of town. As seen on the map in grey, this maneuver shortened the distance to Rowlesburg by half., With the remainder of his forces, Jones moved two miles east to Macomber where the River Road (now WV 72) connected Rowlesburg to the Nortwestern Turnpike. As seen on the map in red, he would send Col. Green and his men on horseback to drive in pickets and attack any perimeter defenses. At two o'clock shots were heard in town from the direction of the river road where Green's forces were driving the pickets back to the Union lines. Green would advance until his troops were less than a mile from town, just beyond a point known as The Cliffs. There a barricade of logs thrown up by the Union forces stopped him, shown on the map as a blue line. As the Confederate cavalry approached, Lt. McDonald of the Union forces ordered his riflemen to fire. Unable to charge past the enemy as Jones had commanded, Green ordered his men to fall back, then sent for Jones., This decision would infuriate Gen. Jones and eventually led to the court-martial of Green that September. Col. Green next ordered troops armed with carbines to dismount and move forward along the road and engage McDonald's force. They came under heavy fire from the mountaineers in the rifle-pits and fell back. Green sent still another dismounted attachment higher up the steep mountainside to circle above McDonald's men. Strengthened by Lieutenant Hathaway's Company K., the Union line held once again. According to one source, Hathaway's force consisted mainly of \"about 20 citizens.\", As the day progressed, the fighting on the river road became a desperate test of wills. According to one source, the battle raged \"at intervals from 3 p.m. until dark....\". Green could do nothing to dislodge the stubborn Rowlesburg troops and townsmen from their impregnable positions. By now, a completely enraged Jones personally commanded the last assault but after seeing that his troops were stalemated, ordered Green to hold his position until dusk and then pull back to the turnpike. Jones, now accepting defeat, decided to move west to camp for the night. According to Jones, \"To renew the attack without the hope of surprise was out of the question, with the difficulties of the ground against us.\" The dreaded Confederate Cavalry was useless to him because of the narrow passage and steep hillside. Like the Persians before him at Thermopylae, geography and a stubborn enemy willing to sacrifice all would defeat Jones., A special target for destruction by order of both Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, and Commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee, Rowlesburg was the only town or outpost in western Virginia that was a principal target of the raid to stand up to the Confederate onslaught and emerge unscathed. \"Lincoln's Lifeline\" was preserved."},{"id":34038,"title":"Rowlesburg Veterans Memorial","pos":[39.34635,-79.66987],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=34038","desc":"Rowlesburg Veterans Memorial. .

The railroad linked the eastern and western Union forces with supplies of food, ammunition and troops., On April 26, 1863, just weeks before the new state of West Virginia would enter the Union, 1,000 Confederate troops led by General W.E. \"Grumble\" Jones arrived, planning to destroy the railroad's bridges, viaducts and trestles in the area., The Sixth West Virginia Infantry, 250 strong and local residents joined forces under the command of Major John Showalter.

Gauley Bridge - A Town in Between. When the war began, most residents of this part of present-day West Virginia were Confederate in their sympathies. Both Confederate and Union forces considered the wooden covered bridge here strategically important because the James River and Kanawha Turnpike linked the Ohio River with the James River. The original bridge piers are in the river to the right of the railroad bridge.,   In the summer of 1861, Confederate Gen. Henry A. Wise, the former governor of Virginia, and his troops controlled the Kanawha River valley. When Union Gen. Jacob D. Cox led his command to the valley in July, Wise retreated. Passing through the community of Gauley Bridge on July 26, he ordered the bridge burned to impede Cox. The Federals established a position near the village and remained there until mid-August, when Cox and his forces left temporarily. After Cox returned, Confederate Gen. John B. Floyd posted guns atop a nearby mountain and shelled the Federals for a week beginning November 1. The artillery fire was ineffective, and Union forces soon maneuvered Floyd into retreating.,   Cox�s men constructed a new wire suspension bridge across the river early in 1862. In the spring, Cox launched an offensive from Gauley Bridge and did not return, although Federal forces continued to occupy the area. In September, Confederate Gen. William W.

With railroads came thousands of workers looking to make a new life in the coalfields. In the late 1800�s and well into the mid-1900�s, many Appalachian miners lived in company towns called &#8220;Coal Camps&#8221;.,   Mine operators built company-owned towns along railroad lines to support the huge numbers of workers arriving daily. A large percentage of the coal miner�s wages was returned to the coal company in exchange for housing, tools, food and other basic expenses. These towns generally consisted of miners� homes, a school, church, post office, and company store. These simple homes were uniform in design and, depending on the company, sometimes all painted the same color throughout the town! ,   Life in these camps was dependent on the coal seam�s production, and in the early 30�s an estimated 465 company towns existed in West Virginia. Over 90 percent of all miners lived in these company-owned camps. Here miners enjoyed many modern amenities unheard of before coal�s discovery including electric power, public libraries, schools, doctors and dentists. ,   Another important place in the coal camp community was the baseball diamond. Games were played on Sunday, which was the only day in the week that the coal miners did not work. ,   In 1930, Kingston coal camp had a population of over 1200 people, with a variety of ethnicities including people from Canada, Lithuania, Argentina, Russia, Austria, Scotland, Cuba, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Greece, Poland, Romania, Italy and Mexico. The Westerly coal camp had a population of over 660 including full-blooded Cherokees, African Americans and immigrants from many nationalities. Most of these once populated and flourishing coal camps have disappeared from the landscape with little remaining evidence of their existence. ,   <b>The Paint Creek Scenic Trail is included within the National Coal Heritage Area.</b>"},{"id":34447,"title":"Civil War","pos":[39.00827,-79.91109],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=34447","desc":"Civil War. . <center>To honor all who served North and South April 12, 1861 to April 9, 1865 donated by Laurel Mountain Post 410 Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States Belington, West Virginia March 1, 1999.

Gateway to the Northwest. Confederate forces retreated from this area after the \"Philippi Races\" (June 3, 1861), first land battle of the Civil War. At Huttonsville, 26 miles south, Confederate General Robert S. Garnett took command of the Army of the Northwest. His goal was to reclaim \"Western\" Virginia., General Garnett identified two mountain passes as the \"gates to the northwestern country.\" The first was at Rich Mountain, 20 miles south. The second was here, on the Beverly-Fairmont Turnpike, at Laurel Hill. Leaving 1,300 men at the stronger post at Rich Mountain, Garnett began to fortify Camp Laurel Hill on June 16, 1861 with the remainder of his 5,300 Confederates., <i>\"Heavy entrenchments are dug around the entire camp, containing an area of one hundred acres. It is, perhaps, the most substantial and complete work of its kind ever built in this country.\"</i> , A Soldier at Laurel Hill, By early July, Federal troops threatened. Maj. General George McClellan led three brigades toward Rich Mountain. Meanwhile, a brigade under Union General Thomas A. Morris marched to Laurel Hill., On this ground, Garnett's Confederates skirmished with a nearly equal force of the enemy. From July 7-11, 1861, gunfire echoed from these ridges. Here soliders of the blue and gray received their baptism of fire., On the evening of July 11, General Garnett learned that the Confederates had been defeated at Rich Mountain. He feared that the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike - his vital supply line to the Shenandoah Valley - had been severed. Abandoning Laurel Hill near midnight, Garnett's army struck east, in a daring bid to escape. On July 13, at a lonely river crossing known as Corricks Ford (Tucker County), pursuing Federals captured most of the Confederate supply wagons and killed General Garnett. Demoralized Confederates fled across the mountains to Monterey, Virginia., Events here in 1861 made General George McClellan a national hero, and solidified Union control of \"Western\" Virginia. To counter the Confederates in Richmond, a delegation of Unionists in Wheeling formed the \"Restored Government of Virginia.\" By 1863, the state of West Virginia was born., <i>\"Our Confederate command under General Garnett confronted that of the Federals under General Morris ... and during that time skirmishing between them, with slight loss, was almost continuous.\"</i>  , French Harding, 31st Virginia Infantry C.S.A., <i>\"We are anxious to meet the foe, for we have them to whip, and the sooner we do it, the sooner we will be able to return to the dear loved ones at home.\"</i> , John B.

Jenifer sued the Confederate government in 1863 for patent infringement and later settled out of court. After losing command of the 8th Virginia Cavalry after an 1862 reorganization, Jenifer served as a cavalry inspector for the duration of the war.

Sectional differences in western and eastern Virginia fueled resentment and political divisions before the Civil War. The divisions soon became irrevocable after the convention in Richmond voted on April 17, 1861, for Virginia to secede and join the Confederacy. Far to the north of here, Wheeling,  delegates of Virginia's western counties convened in June. They first reorganized and restored the loyal government of Virginia, and then  subsequently decided to create a new, loyal state from Virginia's western counties. In the midst of the  conflict, President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill creating West Virginia.

Confederate Sanctuary. When the Civil War began, the Greek Revival-style Moorefield Presbyterian Church consisted of the main sanctuary that fronts on Main Street and the small chapel behind it. The chapel was constructed about 1847, and the sanctuary was completed in 1855., The Rev. William V. Wilson, the minister, was an outspoken Confederate sympathizer as was his congregation, which was composed of Moorefield's prominent, wealthy residents. Many sons of the older congregants served in the county militia and in regular Confederate army units., Even before the fighting began, Wilson urged the members to prepare for large-scale warfare to ensure success. Because his sentiments were well known to Union commanders, Wilson left in February 1862 and never returned. Instead, he served as a chaplain in the Confederate army, principally in the Shenandoah Valley., Both sides utilized the church as a hospital during the war, and Union soldiers burned pews for firewood and stabled their horses inside. Because of the damage, the congregation suspended services from early in 1862 until mid-1865., Merchant Samuel A. McMechen, who lived down the street to your left, struggled to keep the Sunday school operating. Leigh Allen, on his way to Sunday school on March 23, 1862, found Union cavalry here and turned back. When gunfire erupted in his path, he ran into the woods with other townspeople and hid behind a log until evening, and then returned home.

They raised cattle, sheep, and hogs and grew wheat, cotton, and burley tobacco for cigars. As a boy, James Wood learned to ride, shoe horses, repair wagons, and handle firearms, skills that served him well in the cavalry.

John McCausland (bivouacked closer to Moorefield) had taken part in Gen. Jubal A. Early�s raid on Washington, D.C., and had burned Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, in retaliation for Federal &#8220;depredations&#8221; in the Shenandoah Valley, which had likewise been in retaliation for Confederate &#8220;atrocities.&#8221; Union Gen. William W. Averell, whose command was in pursuit, surprised the Confederate pickets north of here by attacking with &#8220;Jesse Scouts&#8221; (Federal soldiers in Confederate uniforms). He drove Johnson�s men south through here toward Parson�s Ford. Averell captured four cannons, more than 400 men with their weapons, and, about as bad for the Confederates at this stage of the war, an equal number of hard-to-replace horses. Early claimed that &#8220;this affair had a very damaging effect upon my cavalry for the rest of the campaign&#8221; in terms of both morale and horses.

Confederate Raid. <i>(Preface):</i> On April 20, 1863, Confederate Gens. William E. \"Grumble\" Jones and John D. Imboden began a raid from Virginia through present-day West Virginia on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Taking separate routes, they later reported that they marched 1,100 miles, fought several engagements, captured 700 Federals, seized about 1,200 horses and 4,000 cattle, and burned 4 turnpike bridges, more than 20 railroad bridges, 2 trains, and 150,000 barrels of oil. Most bridges were soon repaired. Confederate losses were slight. By May 26, both commands had returned to Virginia's Shenandoah Valley., On May 6, 1863, Confederate Gen. William E. \"Grumble\" Jones led his wing of cavalrymen to Harrisville from Weston. Near the western end of town, his men exchanged shots with the Harrisville Home Guard, which then fled. The Home Guard maintained control of the town during the war and was composed of 75 older men and young boys. Jones's men captured many of its members as they fled but soon released them from custody. The fast-moving raiders did not wish to have prisoners encumber them., After the Confederates gained control of the town, they badly damaged the printing shop and Pierpoint's store, and wrecked the U.S. Post Office. They threw the postage stamps that the town's residents needed to mail letters and packages in the mud and trampled them. Jones and his men soon moved on to destroy Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tunnels and bridges, of which there were several in Ritchie County., The Harrisville Baptist Church minutes for May 9 referred to the incident: \"Church failed to meet in consequences of a raid of Rebel Cavalry to the supposed number of 1,500 that entered Harrisville at noon on Thursday.\", <i>(Sidebar):</i> The Confederates raided present-day West Virginia to recruit new troops, \"collect\" cattle and horses, and destroy railroad bridges and tunnels.

In 1861, Sheetz found himself unusually busy converting ancient flintlock rifles to the modern percussion type.,   The long rifle (Pennsylvania or Kentucky rifle) had been popular with frontiersmen since the mid-18th century. The rifleman rammed powder and a bullet down the barrel, poured priming powder in the pan on the side of the lock, and pulled the trigger. A hammer with a piece of flint in its jaws struck the frizzen above the pan to produce a spark that ignited the priming powder and then the main charge through the flash hole, firing the rifle. Rain could foul the powder; in the 19th century, a new waterproof system was invented. A nipple replaced the frizzen and pan, a cap containing priming powder covered the nipple, and the modified hammer struck the cap, igniting the primer and charge. The next technological advance---self-contained metal cartridges---arrived later in the war.,   Confederate Lt.

Prelude to Rich Mountain. <i>(Preface):</i> <small>In the spring of 1861, Union forces rushed into northwestern Virginia to secure the vital Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, protect important turnpikes, and support Unionists against Confederates. The two sides fought numerous engagements between June and December. They included Philippi (the war's first land battle), Rich Mountain, Corricks Ford, Cheat Summit Fort, Carnifex Ferry, and Camp Allegheny. The many Union victories made Gen. George B. McClellan's reputation and damaged that of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee - a situation reversed in 1862. Despite later Confederate raids, today's West Virginia remained largely under Federal control for the rest of the war.</small>, In one of the first important Union victories of the Civil War, on July 11, 1861, Union Gen. George B. McClellan�s forces defeated part of Confederate Gen. Robert S Garnett�s command east of here at Rich Mountain. McClellan�s column camped here early in July before the battle.,  \tOn July 2, McClellan wrote to his wife, Mary Ellen McClellan, that his column was marching to Buckhannon after a series of hard rains and that the local people rejoiced to see his troops. The next day he wrote to her about how cold it was the night before, the first night of camp in Buckhannon. McClellan also sent numerous telegrams to Washington, D.C., complaining about the lack of supplies and describing his intention to defeat Garnett by maneuvers rather than by direct attack.,  \tMcClellan�s subordinate, Gen. William S. Rosecrans, arrived here with his command earlier than anticipated. It earned him McClellan�s wrath for fear the Rosecrans�s early march had alerted the Confederates. McClellan�s column eventually marched out of town along the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike (Main Street in Buckhannon) to Rich Mountain. Ironically, it was Rosecrans�s direct attack there that secured McClellan�s reputation and the appointment to command the Army of the Potomac.,  \tBuckhannon and Upshur County remained largely Unionist during the war. While southern sympathizers were active here, many moved south early in the conflict. Overt signs of support for one side or the other depended on whether Confederate or Federal troops were in the area. Brothers in several local families joined opposite sides in the conflict., <i>(Sidebar):</i> After Samuel Morse invented the telegraph in 1844, wires soon were strung all along the East Coast. During the Civil War, 15,000 miles of telegraph cable was laid purely for military purposes. Mobile telegraph wagons reported and received communications from just behind the front lines.

Malden's Salt Works.  ,  In the decades before the Civil War, this region, called the Kanawha Salines, had a booming salt industry. Salt extraction created vast wealth here, and by 1846, this area had led the nation with 3.2 million bushels produced. During the Civil War, salt was a necessary ingredient for the preservation of meat for the armies. The salt works here at Malden were especially important to the Confederacy.,   Salt businesses relied on slaves, owned or leased, and the workers face difficult conditions. Many jobs were dangerous�mining the coal to boil the brine was especially so. Slaves toiled at the 52 furnaces that lined the Kanawha River for ten miles above Charleston. By 1850, 3,140 slaves lived among the 12,001 white inhabitants, and more than half of the slaves worked in the salt operations.,   Many salt-works owners lived here in Malden, while others built large estates along the Kanawha River in Charleston to escape the heat and pollution of the furnaces.

Although saltpeter (potassium nitrate or nitre), an essential element in the manufacture of gunpowder, had been mined at Organ Cave since the eighteenth century, the need for the mineral increased dramatically during the Civil War. Several saltpeter mines were operated in West Virginia. Confederate soldiers were detailed to operate the mine here beginning in 1861 and ultimately produced a large percentage of the saltpeter used in the production of gunpowder for the Confederate army.,  \tMany of the soldiers lived in the cave during the harsh winters and conducted religious services in the Chapel Room. A stream flowing through the cave provided water for cooking, washing, and drinking. The soldiers constructed fifty-two vats, or hoppers, to separate the saltpeter from the rock and soil in which it was found. Thirty-seven hoppers remain in the Hopper Room, the largest collection in the United States. The soldiers lugged sacks of soil to the hopper, where the water was poured through to leach out the saltpeter. It took an estimated 2,000 pounds of soil, carried in 14-16 trips, to fill one hopper. When two hundred pounds of saltpeter had been extracted, it was shipped to Southern gunpowder factories, such as the one in Augusta, Georgia.,  \tOn August 19, 1863, Gen. William W.

A slave-auction block stood at the northwestern corner of the Second Ward market house here. Judge John Cochran described it in his book, <i>Bonnie Belmont</i>. In 1855, he wrote, \"a wooden movable platform about two and a half feet high and six feed square, approached by some three or four steps. The auctioneer was a little dapper fellow with a ringing voice. Not a very large crowd was surrounding the auction block. On top of it was a portly and rather aged negress and the auctioneer.\" Such scenes increased the opposition to slavery here.,   The antebellum Deep South had an insatiable need for slave labor for the cotton plantations there. Virginia, America's largest slaveholding state, exported half a million slaves to points south and west. Wheeling was part of that network, the destination of the overland route from Baltimore to the Ohio River and then to slave markets in Charleston (present-day West Virginia), Kentucky, and along the Mississippi River. Coffles of shackled slaves passed through Wheeling on the National Road and later were transported by railroad to be \"sold down river.\" Held in pens nearby, slaves sometimes escaped with the assistance of conductors on the Underground Railroad based in Martins Ferry, Ohio.

The first major battle was during the Revolutionary War in September 1777 when the British led 300 Wyandot, Mingo, and Shawnee Indians against the settlement. Originally called Fort Fincastle, the fort was later named Fort Henry in honor of the famous patriot Patrick Henry. The fort was located on the hill in what is now the 1000 block of Main Street.,   The Wheeling National Heritage Area preserves and celebrates the city's dramatic setting, resources, and history, including its role as the birthplace of the state of West Virginia during the Civil War. ,   A National Heritage Area is a part of our county's landscape that has been recognized by the United States Congress for its unique contribution to the American Experience.,   <i>[Captions:]</i> , <small> &#10102; In 1777, Major Samuel McColloch narrowly escaped an Indian assault by riding his horse off Wheeling hill over a 300-foot cliff. Major McColloch had just led his troops into the safety of Fort Henry when he was cut-off by hostile Indians. He escaped that day only to be caught and killed five years later in July 1782. As was the traditional practice, the Native Americans presumably cut out McCulloch's heart and ate it to gain his courage.,   &#10103; The final attack on Fort Henry was September 1782 and is recognized as the last battle of the Revolutionary War. During that siege when gunpowder was running dangerously low, Betty Zane, a young settler, dashed to retrieve gunpowder stored in the a building outside of the fort's safety. Her heroic run saved Fort Henry and its inhabitants.,   &#10104; Early residents of the Ohio Valley, the Mingo Indians were related to the Iroquois Indians. These Native Americans lived by hunting deer, buffalo, fox, wild turkeys, beaver, and bald eagles, and they also traded with the Europeans.

Harrison County was among the first jurisdictions in western Virginia to support the Union. A pro-Union meeting was called for November 24, 1860, at the Clarksburg Courthouse, just after Abraham Lincoln had been elected president and many Southern states were talking of secession. An anonymous Clarksburg resident wrote prophetically on January 12, 1861, \"We intend if eastern Virginia secedes to raise the banner of separate State sovereignty in Western Virginia and remain in the Union.\",   On April 17, 1861, the Virginia Secession Convention voted 88 to 55 to send the Ordinance of Secession to the people of Virginia for ratification. Delegates from western Virginia argued in vain against seceding from the Union then left Richmond under threat of bodily harm. After returning to Clarksburg, Unionist leader John S. Carlile called a public meeting in Harrison County. On April 22, almost 1,200 residents convened at the courthouse in Clarksburg to determine what course to take in this national crisis. From this meeting came the call for what would be known as the First Wheeling Convention on May 13, thereby setting the stage for West Virginia statehood. When the vote on the Ordinance of Secession was taken, the men of Harrison County voted against it 1,691 to 694.,   <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  John Snyder Carlile was a delegate from Harrison County who resided in Clarksburg, served as a state senator, a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850-1851, and a congressman. He voted against secession at the convention in 1861 and headed the movement to form a new state government for Virginia on the grounds that secession had caused the state government offices to be vacated. He was elected to the United States Senate under the Restored Government of Virginia and at first supported but then opposed statehood for West Virginia when Congress included a provision in the statehood bill requiring gradual emancipation. Although he had been one of the earliest advocates of statehood, ultimately he voted against the bill.

Later, Henderson was elected to the legislature of the Restored Government of Virginia, serving from 1861 until the new state was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863.,   Part of a February 1861 letter from Arthur I. Boreman, later the first governor of West Virginia, likely expressed Henderson�s own feelings about the imminent division of the nation: &#8220;Why should we risk a new government in the south when we are already governed by the best constitution ever and God given freedoms which might disappear under a new government after secession?&#8221;,   Located on the main road between Marietta, Ohio, and Parkersburg, West Virginia, Henderson Hall lay in the path of Union troops moving overland when the Ohio River was unsuitable for transportation. After arriving in Marietta by train, the men marching down the road to Parkersburg frequently camped hereto rest, drill, and conduct artillery practice. Henderson�s well-known support of the Union probably saved his house and farm from plundering by passing soldiers.,   <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  George Washington Henderson built Henderson Hall in two construction campaigns after his marriage in 1826 to Elizabeth Ann Tomlinson. The first section of the house, built about 1836, now appears as a rear addition to the grand Italianate-style mansion before you. Henderson hired architect and master builder John M. Slocomb of Marietta, Ohio, to design and construct this part of the dwelling between 1856 and 1859. An important and rare example of the style (the Greek Revival was more popular at the time), the house is as notable for its interior finishes as for its exterior. In addition, not only the Henderson furnishings but also the family papers have survived, including those of the statehood period. The mansion and its outbuildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

George B. McClellan, commander of the Department of Ohio, was informed in May 1861 that Confederates were threatening the railroad. McClellan decided to protect the terminus at Parkersburg, and on May 27, he sent the 14th and 18th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, together with the Cleveland Light Artillery, to occupy the city. The units departed Marietta, Ohio, on steamboats and landed in Parkersburg to find the residents were glad to see them.,   McClellan arrived with his staff from Cincinnati on June 22. He inspected the facilities here, including the future site of Fort Boreman, before moving east. Before the next month was over, he had fought and won battles at Rich Mountain and Corrick�s Ford in western Virginia, defeating troops under Gen. Robert E.

McClellan�s reports to Washington proclaimed, &#8220;Our success is complete and secession is killed in this country.&#8221;,   The Union occupation of Parkersburg continued until the end of the war.

The B&O, the most important east-west rail line that linked the Atlantic coast with the American interior, was vitally important for the safe shipment of military supplies as well as the U.S. Army troops. The safety of the railroad, however, depended on its being defended against Confederate attacks that could occur anywhere along the hundreds of miles of track. Although Federal officials at first were slow to act, eventually a series of blockhouses and fortifications were constructed to protect the line itself as well as rail yards and bridges.,   On August 21, 1863, Col. Daniel Frost, 11th West Virginia Infantry, took formal possession of Fort Boreman (named for the new state�s first governor, Arthur I. Boreman.) Although Frost declared the fort completed and ready for heavy artillery in September, in fact improvements, such as huts for winter quarters, continued to be made as late as November. During the remainder of the war, several artillery units manned the fort successively. The guns were fired only for visiting dignitaries and on special occasions, such as the Fourth of July, never in anger. After the war, the fort was razed, and the quarters were burned.,   The site of Fort Boreman was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.,   <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  Arthur I.

He studied law under his older brother and his brother-in-law James McNeill Stephenson of Parkersburg. Boreman was admitted to the bar in 1845 and practiced in Parkersburg. Elected to the first of his many political offices in 1855, Borman was president of the Second Wheeling Convention, First and Adjourned Sessions (June-August 1861), and a circuit court judge in Parkersburg thereafter.

Parkersburg was permanently settled in 1785 by Capt. James Neal, a veteran of Lord Dunmore�s War and the Revolutionary War.

In 1857, the Northwestern Virginia Railroad, the southern trunk of the B&O Railroad, was completed to Parkersburg. The absolute necessity of protecting the turnpikes and railroad made Parkersburg one of the most strategic spots in the state during the war.

It is the largest tributary of that river, the longest in North America.,  Fort Boreman was constructed during the Civil War on what was formerly called Mount Logan because the site commanded a stunning view of the river which was vital to riverboat transportation and critical to the war effort. Because of the bend in the river at Parkersburg, no other location in Mid-Ohio Valley provided such a wide-ranging view. Before the railroad bridge was built, from 1857-1860 cars of the Northwestern Virginia Railroad and the Marietta-Cincinnati Railroad had to be uncoupled, ferried across the river, and reassembled on the other side.

First chartered by the Virginia Assembly in 1800 as Newport, the town was rechartered in 1820, when the legislature recognized its change in name and authorized a trustee form of government.,   At the beginning of the Civil War, Parkersburg had a population of 2,500, having doubled in size during the 1850s. The completion of the southern branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to the town in 1857 increased the size and importance of Parkersburg, then the largest Ohio River town between Wheeling and Cincinnati. ,   It was the railroad that made Parkersburg strategically important during the war. There were two depots - an inner and an outer one - a roundhouse, repair shops that were vital to maintaining the railroad�s rolling stock, telegraph office, two-story freight shed, two steam operated elevators that serviced the loading dock, a railroad stockyard, and a wharf along the Little Kanawha River.,   Parkersburg in 1861 was mostly confined to the area that is now the downtown section. Several hotels such as the luxurious Swann House hosted travelers and military officers. The area near the Little Kanawha River was notoriously grimy and lawless, especially on Saturday nights. The town�s only full-time policeman, George Creel, had difficulty maintain order at times. This section was noted for its saloons, brothels, and seedy boarding houses.,   The Civil War unalterably shaped the character of the city. By 1870, the population had increased to over 5,500.

Fort Boreman was a military fortification constructed by the United States Army during the Civil War. The protection of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the two turnpikes, the Northwestern and the Staunton-Parkersburg, and river port facilities was absolutely essential to the Union war effort. Because of its strategic location as a transportation center, tens of thousands of soldiers traveled through Parkersburg between 1861 and 1865.,   Fort Boreman gave the sentinels atop the hill a grand view of river traffic, the railroads, and the turnpikes. Under the command of Col. Daniel Frost, the soldiers of Company A of the Eleventh West Virginia Infantry began constructing the fort in June 1863. The fort itself was a triangular structure with a powder magazine. Also at the site were winter quarters and a stable. There were five gun stations on the northwest and northeast faces of the fort. The artillery pieces at the citadel included two 12-pound siege guns, one six-pound field gun, and two three-inch guns.,   The fortification consisted of trenches constructed in a zigzag pattern ringed with rifle pits and firing holes cut into the logs. They were capable of holding 100 men. Fort Boreman never saw any hostile military action, and its guns were fired only on celebratory occasions. One soldier, Richard Miller, was killed on August 14, 1863, when during one such occasion, a gun misfired.,   Fort Boreman was occupied in the last year of the war by Batteries D, G, and H, First West Virginia Light Artillery and finally by the Thirty-Second New York Independent Battery. Battery D, also known as the Wheeling Light Artillery, was under the command of Capt. John Carlin. The Fort Boreman site, previously owned by Jonathan B.

Locally, the two-story house became known as the �house of doom�; many of the patients died and were buried in the pest house cemetery.,   To the left of the entry road, just before reaching the park entrance is the site of the infamous hangings of 1867. The men, Daniel Grogan, Thomas Boice, and Mortimer Gibbony, were convicted for the murder of Abram Deem, a well-respected Wood County farmer who was a Confederate sympathizer. Though local lore credits a notorious �hanging tree� as the gallows, the men were actually hanged from a scaffold.,   In 1893, on a knoll on the western side of Fort Boreman Hill, Gustavus Fries built a public park consisting of ten-pin bowling lanes, a dance hall, concession stand, and picnic areas. In addition to a shaded place to relax and enjoy a natural setting, Fries Park offered a venue for musical concerts and even hosted prize fights. The park remained active into the 1940s.,   Fort Boreman Hill has been the site of diverse uses for thousands of years; strategic defense, amusement, medical quarantine, and public hangings, and now, in continuance of its public service, as a place to memorialize and remember the past."},{"id":73619,"title":"Old Tollgate House","pos":[39.2633,-81.5425],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=73619","desc":"Old Tollgate House. .

Ripley Post Office.  ,  During the Civil War, both Union and Confederate supporters formed guerrilla bands. Each government denounced the other side�s partisans as bushwhackers or common thieves but gave those on their own side an official military designation as cover. When Capt. George Downs, of Calhoun County, formed the Moccasin Rangers, for example the Confederate government designated the unit the 19th Virginia Cavalry.,   On December 19, 1861, the Rangers raided Ripley. Union Lt. Owen G. Chase, 9th (West) Virginia Infantry who was in town that day recruiting for Federal forces had disarmed the residents and locked the weapons in the jail. He probably suspected many of the townspeople of being Confederate sympathizers. Chase then marched his recruits west of town.,   That evening, Pvt. Daniel Duskey and twelve other Rangers came into Ripley, took the arms from the jail, looted J.L. Armstrong�s store, and robbed local residents. When Postmaster John J. Wetzel refused to unlock the post office door, Duskey retorted that he had a key to unlock any door and kicked it down. The Rangers took everything of value, including all of Wetzel�s clothing except what he was wearing.,   Duskey and Jacob Varner, another Ranger, were captured a few weeks later. They were convicted of robbery as civilians, since the government did not recognize the legitimacy of the Rangers, and were confined in Albany N.Y. On November 25, 1862, Confederates captured Union Capt. William Gramm and Lt. Isaac A. Wade near Charleston and then held them in Richmond. President Abraham Lincoln pardoned Duskey and Varner on June 13, 1863, so that they could be exchanged for the officers.,   <blockquote> <i>\"As the Judge, Jury, Marshal, District Attorney and Post Master General join in asking a pardon in this case, I have concluded to grant it.

Serving Opposite Sides. Although western Virginia eventually separated from the original state to form West Virginia and join the Union, many residents of the new state supported the Confederacy. Many others served the Union, while still others wished to avoid contact with either side. Sometimes these differences produced a &#8220;war within the war&#8221; that divided neighbors and split families, often with bloody results. Here in Jackson County, in the nearby community of Staats Mill, an example of the divisions within West Virginia was rendered in poetry. ,   Two prominent residents, Nicholas Casto and Elihugh Powers, took opposite positions during the war. Casto became a captain in the Home Guard that was formed to protect Unionists from Confederate raiders, while Powers supported the Confederacy. The Guard sometimes gathered in a nearby cavern on Straight Run, a branch of Tug Fork of Mill Creek. The cavern became known as the Casto Hole. It also served local residents who wished to conceal their property from the foraging soldiers of both sides.,   According to legend, Casto wrote a poem critical of the Confederacy and Powers, who then retaliated with his own poem. It soon became a ballad: &#8220;The Casto Hole.&#8221; Allegedly, while Powers was shingling a roof, he wrote twenty-seven verses, one on each shingle, nineteen verses survived. Although the lyrics blistered Casto and the Unionists, the song became so popular that even the Casto family was said to enjoy it after the war ended.,   <b>From &#8220;The Casto Hole&#8221;:</b>,   <i>Far in the woods on Upper Tug ,  They wrap old Union in a rug ,  Where Nicolas reads the Union Roll ,  And rallies �round the Casto Hole.,   The Casto Hole is a cavern deep ,  Where Union men can quite sleep ,  Where all their warlike plans unfold ,  While forted in the Casto Hole. ,  � ,  Poor old Joel, he died of late ,  And took his flight to the Pearly Gate ,  Saint Peter knew the poor old soul ,  And kicked him back to the Casto Hole.</i>,    <b>(captions)</b> ,  (lower left) Cavern above the Casto Hole - <i>Courtesy Mike McGrew</i> ,  (upper right) Home Guard meeting <i>Courtesy West Virginia State Archives</i>"},{"id":73652,"title":"Staats Mill Covered Bridge","pos":[38.79443,-81.68718],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=73652","desc":"Staats Mill Covered Bridge. .

Besides county militiamen, two other units defended Barboursville from a hill overlooking the Mud River; the Sandy Rangers, under Capt. James Corns, and the Border Rangers, under Capt. James Ferguson. Albert G. Jenkins, subsequently the commander of the 8th Virginia Infantry and later a general, had recruited the Border Rangers. As the Federals neared the covered bridge, the Confederates opened fire. The Kentuckians fixed bayonets and charged up the hill, driving out the defenders. One of them, who had never seen a bayonet, wrote that \"I loaded and fired till the Yankees began to load with butcher knives, then I thought it was time to be going.\" Casualties were light on both sides.

The unit entered Confederate service in May 1861. The Border Rangers took part in several skirmishes, raids, and battles during the first year of the war.,   Early in 1862, Jenkins was elected to the first Confederate Congress and served until August, when he was promoted to brigadier general and returned to the field. He then launched his famous raid through Western Virginia, and on September 4, he and his men crossed the Ohio River and planted the first Confederate banner in Ohio.,   Jenkins and his men returned to the Kanawha Valley early in 1863 and fought most notably at Hurricane Bridge and Point Pleasant. In June, he was recalled to the Shenandoah Valley to join Gen. Robert E. Lee�s forces for the Gettysburg Campaign.

One is that she barricaded herself and her children in the brick kitchen and refused to come out.

McClellan, commanding the Department of the Ohio, launched the first campaign, ordering troops to cross the Ohio River and secure \"Western\" Virginia for the Union., Here, during June-July 1861, McClellan's army won the inaugural Union victories of the Civil War. Hailed as the North's first battlefield hero, McClellan was summoned to Washington on July 22, following a stunning Union debacle at Manassas, Virginia. Federal troops now occupied Western Virginia, as loyal delegates met in Wheeling to form the \"Restored Government of Virginia,\" a Union government to oppose the Confederate one in Richmond., By August 1861, Southern forces again threatened. Confederate General Robert E. Lee attempted to reclaim Western Virginia, but failed miserably. Troops of both armies remained to guard the mountain passes during that terrible winter. By 1862, conflict shifted east. The first campaign proved to be decisive: the western counties under Union control became the new state of West Virginia in 1863.

Harrison Hagans opened the Virginia Iron Furnace you see here in 1854.

A wooden raceway brought water from Muddy Creek and Crab Orchard Run. The 50-food water wheel pumped bellows that blew air into the fire. This kept temperatures at 2600� to 3000� F. At the right time, workers opened a tiny door at the bottom of the stack. The molten iron flowed into sand molds, called the sow, and cooled into pigs. They dumped leftover slag, made of limestone and iron impurities, over the hill.  , Hagans would not have built this iron furnace without a nearby stream to provide water power.

The first permanent settlers arrived at Paint Creek in the early 19th century. Agriculture was the dominant way of life for those first settlers who called these rugged mountains home. Some farmers became very successful farmers with large landholdings; however, most farmers struggled to sustain their families on a rough subsistence lifestyle. The pastoral charm of the more successful farming communities can still be seen today along Paint Creek in the communities of Sweeneyburg, Maynor, Cirtsville, and Lively.,  When railroads arrived and opened the door to vast coal deposits, many farmers gave up the plow to work in the mines. Only the most successful farmers retained an agricultural lifestyle, and these farmers enjoyed a relatively affluent lifestyle compared to the miners in the coal camps. While mining was not easy work, the steady income and access to company stores made the tradeoff worthwhile for many. Within a short period of time, Paint Creek transformed from a land of scattered farms and homesteads to a land bustling with coal camps and the sound of steam engines.,  The shift from agriculture to mining did not remove agriculture from the blood of the miners. Immigrant miners, many of whom had been farmers in their home lands, brought agricultural skills with them. Gardens became a common sight in the coal camps. Because miners' wives did not have any other local industry available to them, they often tended gardens and kept animals with the help of their children. Gardening provided a safeguard against inconsistent employment, economic depressions, and strikes that frequently swept the coalfields. Gardening also helped minters reduce their dependency on company stores and avoid debt. Some miners used the bounty of their gardens to produce homebrew which they sold for supplemental income.,  The Paint Creek Scenic Trail is included within the National Coal Heritage Area. Funding for this project was provided in part by the Beckley Area Foundation and The Federal Highway Administration.,  <b>[Photo captions, from top left around to top right, read] ,  1.</b> Carl Pittman navigates a horse-drawn cart in Maple Fork.

Prior to the construction of the West Virginia Turnpike, this road was the main route of travel between Beckely and Charleston. Today, the Paint Creek Scenic Trail offers travelers a leisurely and scenic alternative to travel on the Turnpike. Visitors can learn about the natural, cultural, and historic heritage of this storied landscape, as well as enjoy some of southern West Virginia's finest trout fishing. Two byway sections offer a well-maintained single lane road that is accessible to all vehicles. One backway segment is a remote and narrow paved roadway that is unsuitable for tour buses and RVs, but will appeal to those in search of a true off-the-beaten-path adventure."},{"id":75147,"title":"Preston County / Maryland","pos":[39.41933,-79.48402],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=75147","desc":"Preston County, also, Maryland. .  , <b>Preston County.</b> Formed from Monongalia in 1818 and named for James Preston, 13th governor of Virginia.

Delawares, Mingoes, Ottawas, Senecas, Shawnees, Cherokees, Catawbas, and others regularly traveled Paint Creek to and from settlements in western Virginia. Indians frequently used the area as a staging ground for incursions into European settlements that were encroaching from the east.,  When European explorers arrived, Paint Creek abounded with visual evidence of Native American activity, the most obvious evidence being the \"painted trees\" for which Paint Creek is named. Before European contact, many American Indian nations did not have written languages or alphabets. Some tribes used glyphic writing systems of symbols and pictures to transmit information. Along Paint Creek, many war and hunting parties painted pictographs on trees to transmit information about their exploits, or to mark trails. Early settlers named two prominent areas of painted trees near the present-day Raleigh/Fayette County line as \"The Big Painted Trees\" and \"The Upper Painted Trees\".,  In 1755, Shawnee warriors abducted Mary Ingles and her two sons from their family's homestead near present-day Blacksburg, Virginia. The warriors led Mary down Paint Creek en route to a Shawnee village near Portsmouth, Ohio. After a time, Mary and a fellow captive carried out a daring escape. With fierce determination and one tomahawk in hand, Mary began a treacherous 450 mile journey back to Virginia. Along the way, it is believed that Mary may have attempted to find her original route through Paint Creek, but was unsuccessful. Instead, Mary began a harrowing journey up the New River Gorge. Mary was found alive lying in a corn patch near present-day Eggleston, VA, and she eventually re-united with her husband.,  <b>Indian Trails of Raleigh County</b> ,  The Indian path on Paint Creek was one of many similar paths that crisscrossed the area of present-day Raleigh County. One major junction of Indian trails was located just north of Pax near the site of \"The Big Painted Trees\". Here, a major path branched off and headed northwest toward the Coal River. Another path branched south toward the Bluestone River and Virginia. This path toward Virginia - often called the \"Paint Creek Trail\" - traveled through the east side of present-day Beckley where Kanawha Street is located.,  <b>[Photo captions read] ,  1.</b> This re-creation of an 18th century Delaware (Lenape) Indian war party record depicts a military maneuver in western Virginia.

Strategic Position. In 1861, during the early part of the Civil War, Union Gen. Benjamin F. Kelley established Camp Washington here on the Washington Bottom Farm to secure the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in this area. Located between Romney and Cumberland, Maryland, the site was close to the wire bridge over the South Branch of the Potomac River. Despite the large Federal presence here and elsewhere, Confederate raiders struck periodically along the lengthy rail line. Troops from both sides moved periodically through Romney, and Confederate forces occasionally occupied this campsite.,   Confederate Lt. Col. Turner Ashby, 7th Virginia Cavalry, established his headquarters here early in the summer of 1861, after Federal forces temporarily withdrew. His younger brother, Richard Ashby, died here from wounds sustained in an engagement on Kelly�s Island on the Potomac River on June 28. Turner Ashby took his brother�s death hard, and his grief intensified his determination to fight. Almost a year later, on June 6, 1862, Turner Ashby was killed in action south of Harrisonburg, Virginia. His remains lie in Stonewall Cemetery in Winchester, Virginia. At first Richard Ashby was buried in Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney, but after the war his body was disinterred and re-buried beside his brother.,   <i>�Poor Dick went into the war like myself, not to regard himself or our friends, but to serve our country in this time of peril. �His country has lost the services of a brave man with a strong arm, which he proved upon her enemies in losing his life. �He was buried with all the honors of war, and never was greater respect paid to the memory of one man; it was indeed a triumph of his bravery. I had him buried in a beautiful cemetery in Romney.�</i> ,  Turner Ashby to his sister Dora, Camp Washington, July 7, 1861,   <b>(captions)</b> ,  (top center) Gen. Benjamin F. Kelley; Gen.

Federal Attack on Romney. On October 24, 1861, Union Gen. Winfield Scott ordered Gen. Benjamin F. Kelley to strengthen his position at New Creek Station (present-day Keyser) on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and then march to Romney and occupy the town. Situated on the North Western Turnpike and the largest town in the South Branch Valley, Romney had strategic importance. Kelley planned a two-pronged attack for October 26. He led the main force from the west on the turnpike, while Col. Thomas Johns, 2nd Regiment Potomac Home Brigade, attacked from the north. Johns was to push across the Wire Bridge here, march south, and strike Romney from the east.,   Johns, however, encountered stiff resistance her. He reported that Confederates had entrenched �riflemen on an eminence immediately fronting the suspension bridge. Captain Alexander Shaw, of Company A, who led the advance of the column to this point, was with his company, directed to lead the way across the bridge, at a double quick step. � About half way across the bridge, [Shaw] discovered that a portion of the plank flooring on the further side had been removed. The enemy on discovering the movement, open fire by volley, killing one and wounding six of my men, causing the company to seek shelter behind the parapets of the bridge.�,   When Johns heard Kelley�s guns firing as the general entered Romney, Johns broke off contact and withdrew to Maryland, considering his part of the attack complete.,   Kelley�s troops occupied Romney until January 10, 1862, when they retreated to Cumberland, Maryland, over this bridge as Confederate Gen.

Aaron and Samuel Bloch began making chewing tobacco after experimenting with \"cigar scrap.\" This afterthought quickly became a favorite with local coal miners and soon the rest of the country took notice with the help of Mail Pouch barns. From such humble beginnings grew one of America's most easily recognizable products. Mail Pouch's rustic appeal and popular barn advertisements have become a symbol of Americana.,  <b>1. Mail Pouch Barns</b> ,  Beginning in 1925, Bloch Brothers began advertising their products using the now famous Mail Pouch barn signs, featuring \"CHEW MAIL POUCH - TREAT YOURSELF TO THE BEST.\" In 1947, the company hired painter Harley Warrick, who became synonymous with the signs. During his 35-year career, Harley painted between 16,000 and 18,000 barns. Occasionally, Harley would deliberately misspell a word and wait to see just how long it would take for people to notice. Approximately 1,000 of these barns are still standing within a 500-mile radius from Wheeling, WV.,  <b>2. \"West Virginia Cole Slaw\"</b> ,  In 1897, Bloch Brothers introduced Mail Pouch Chewing Tobacco, which became their signature product. At first, their chewing tobacco was taken from the scraps and trimmings from other tobacco products. These were mixed with molasses and other flavors, earning the nickname \"West Virginia Cole Slaw.\" Mail Pouch tobacco has been made in Wheeling for over a century. At its zenith, the company employed hundreds of female workers and produced 120 million packages of Mail Pouch a year. The company was said to have known the location of every new oil field in this country, because an order for Mail Pouch was received from the fields as soon as operations began. At one point, Bloch Brothers Tobacco was offering a dozen kinds of pipe tobacco.,  <b>3. Bloch Brothers</b> ,  The Bloch family emigrated to Wheeling from Germany in the 1840s and opened a dry goods store on Main Street, between 12th and 14th Streets. The enterprising family also ran a stogie operation on the second floor of the building. After the flood of 1884 destroyed their grocery inventory, Aaron and Samuel Bloch sold their interests in the dry goods business and focused on tobacco production. The fact that the flood did not destroy their tobacco was taken as a sign that tobacco was their future.,  ----------------- ,  The Wheeling National Heritage Area preserves and celebrates the city's dramatic setting, resources, and history, including its role as the birthplace of the state of West Virginia during the Civil War.,  A National Heritage Area is a part of our country's landscape that has been recognized by the United States Congress for its unique contribution to the American experience., "},{"id":83124,"title":"South Side World Wars Memorial","pos":[40.04918,-80.72609],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=83124","desc":"South Side World Wars Memorial. . <p><center> Dedicated in honor of the  men and women  of the South Side  who served in  World Wars I and II.

Kanawha Boulevard has gone by various names throughout history. The Boulevard was known as Front Street when \"Charles Town\" was chartered in 1794. Through the years, it has been called First Street, Water Street and Kanawha Street prior to being renamed Kanawha Boulevard in the late 1920s.,  The Boulevard served as part of the James River and Kanawha Turnpike and is currently part of the Midland Trail National Scenic Byway. In the late 1930s, the Boulevard was modified into a four-lane highway by the Public Works Administration (PWA).,   The PWA was formed by the National Industrial Recovery Act on June 16, 1933 as a New Deal program to help the country climb out of the Great Depression. The PWA was signed into legislation during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first 100 days in office to fund large-scale construction projects to provide employment, stabilize purchasing power, improve public welfare, and revive American industry.,  The short lived PWA (1933-1941) is often confused with the better known Works Progress Administration (WPA which was created two years after the PWA to fund smaller construction projects throughout the country.,  Kanawha Boulevard and its contributing elements are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places due to their association with the PWA. The contributing elements include the original stone slope treatment, drainage outlets, recreational pathways and steps. In 2014, the original stone slope treatment was enscapsulated and the lower sets of steps and drainage outlets were removed as part of a Section 14 project authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1946.

Large-scale mining in Putnam County ended in the 1940s, when rising costs made profits vanish. Additionally, the coming of World War II siphoned away labor to the armed forces and to munitions plants. ,  The coal vein that runs through Putnam County contained a large amount of clay, which posed a cave-in hazard.

Matewan and the surrounding area have a rich and sometimes violent history that revolves around coal, the railroad and flooding. In the early 19th century, the Ferrell family settled in the area along the northern edge of Tug Fork and a then-unnamed tributary. Legend has it that Richard Ferrell named the tributary Mate Creek after his favorite dog, Mate, who drowned during a hunt while chasing a bear across the ice at the mouth of Mate Creek. The remainder of the town�s name is attributed to Erskine Hazard, a civil engineer working for the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W, now Norfolk Southern Corporation). Hazard laid out and mapped the community already developing along the north edge of the Tug Fork in 1890, and suggested naming the settlement after his hometown of Matteawan, New York. An abridged version of the name, Matewan, became common usage, likely to match the name of the nearby creek. The railroad reached the town in 1892, which attracted newcomers to the area, as did available jobs at the nearby mines of the Williamson Coal Field. Coal companies built housing for workers throughout the area, and Matewan was incorporated in 1895. ,   ,  The area is known for violence associated with the Hatfield-McCoy feud, which some claim was exaggerated by the press. The post-Civil War feud involved multiple generations of Hatfields, led by &#8220;Devil Anse&#8221; Hatfield, and McCoys, led by Randolph &#8220;Ole Ran�l&#8221; McCoy. The McCoys lived primarily on the Kentucky side of Tug Fork while the Hatfield on the West Virginia side. The first violence between the families reportedly occurred in 1865, shortly after the end of the war. Local ex-Confederate militia, calling themselves the Logan Wildcats, were suspected of killing returning Union soldier, Asa Harman McCoy, who was Randall McCoy�s brother. Although no one was charged with the murder, it was rumored that Devil Anse Hatfield and the Logan Wildcats were involved. Repeated violent encounters between 1878 and 1891 led to the deaths of approximately 12 members of the two families. ,   ,  The Mine Wars of the early 1920s centered around the United Mine Workers� attempt to organize miners in the southwestern West Virginia smokeless coal fields. The union controversy combined with other factors created a volatile climate in the area that erupted in several violent events: the Battle of Matewan on May 19, 1920; the three-day Battle of the Tug May 12-14, 1921; the killing of Police Chief Sid Hatfield and his deputy, Ed Chambers, in Welch on August 1, 1921; and the Battle of Blair Mountain in August and September of 1921. ,   ,  The turmoil set off by these events caused Governor Cornwell to activate the recently established West Virginia State Police to restore order. Cornwell and successive Governor Ephraim Morgan repeatedly requested and received help from federal troops. Both governors declared martial law in Mingo County on several occasions, at one time for a stretch of 15 months (June 1921--September 1922). By 1922 the state�s militia (national guard) and the State Police�s less than 300 members were stretched thin by the numerous incidents of labor unrest. ,   ,  Tug Fork has caused flooding in the area since the earliest recorded settlement, and it has flooded Matewan an estimated 36 times since 1949. Major floods in 1957 and 1963 were followed by a record flood of April 4, 1977, which led to the destruction of over one-third of all dwellings, City Hall, a medical clinic and other facilities. Following the devastation of that flood, legislation was passed providing for construction of floodwalls in the region. Construction of the Matewan floodwall and supporting levee began in 1985, a year after another major flood hit the town, and was completed in 1996. A mural on the 2,350-foot wall depicts the Battle of Matewan and other events in local history. ,   ,  The Matewan Depot replica museum includes details about these and other aspects of the region�s history. The Hatfield-McCoy feud and Battle of Matewan are regularly commemorated in the reenactments and other heritage events."},{"id":87950,"title":"Matewan and the Railroad","pos":[37.62272,-82.16826],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=87950","desc":"Matewan and the Railroad. . The Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W, now Norfolk Southern Corporation) has played a crucial role in Matewan�s history. The railraod reached the Matewan area in 1892 as part of the N&W�s Ohio Extension, which provided a direct route from Bluefield through the southwest West Virginia coalfields to the Ohio River. Matewan was incorporated in 1895 and soon became a regional center. The railroad tracks formed the central spine of the town, and several of Matewan�s historic commercial buildings have double facades, with one side facing the tracks and the other facing Mate Street. ,   ,  The original Matewan Depot (below) was built in 1893 and served as a combined passenger and freight depot. Large quantities of coal passed through on their way east, and passengers could take the train east toward Bluefield or northwest to Williamson and beyond. The original depot fell into disrepair after the passenger trains stopped in 1969, and was torn down a few years later. The existing depot reconstruction was built in 2002 based on standard N&W plans to the west and across the tracks from the original depot and serves as a museum of the region�s rich heritage. ,   ,  The railroad continues to play a major role in Matewan and in the region�s economy. In 2007 Norfolk Southern Corporation began the Heartland Corridor rail clearance project, which included modification of tunnels and bridges to allow double-stacked freight cars to travel between the Port of Virginia and destinations in the Midwest and beyond. The nearby Hatfield Tunnel #2, which passes through Kentucky from Sprigg to Matewan, West Virginia, was part of this project. Originally blasted from local bedrock in the late 19th to early 20th centuries, Hatfield Tunnel #2 needed modifications to improve the structural integrity and increase clearance through the use of shotcrete and rock dowel reinforcement. , "},{"id":88500,"title":"Major Robert Augustus Bailey","pos":[38.10925,-80.26893],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=88500","desc":"Major Robert Augustus Bailey. .

Buckeye. <b>Indigo Bunting</b> ,  <i>(Passerina cyanea)</i> lndigo Buntings have no blue pigment; they are actually black, but the diffraction of light through the structure of the feathers makes them appear blue.

Small, conical bill,   <b>White-tailed Deer</b> ,  <i>(Odocoileus virginianus)</i> The White-tailed Deer grazes on green plants, including aquatic ones in the summer; eats acorns, beechnuts, and other nuts and corn in the fall; and in winter browses on woody vegetation, including the twigs and buds of viburnum, birch, maple, and many conifers. The four-part stomach allows the deer to feed on items that most other mammals cannot eat.,   A young doe bred for the &#64257;rst time usually produces one fawn, but thereafter has twins and occasionally triplets if food is abundant. The female remains near the fawns, returning to feed them only once or twice a day.,   <b>Periodical Cicada</b> ,  <i>(Magicicada septendecim)</i> The immature cicadas, called nymphs, do not feed on the twig where they hatch but drop to the ground and burrow to the root system below the tree. Once attached they stay on the root for 13 or 17 years until the next emergence.,   Cicadas are not poisonous and do not have a stinger. Communities and farms with large numbers of cicadas emerging from the ground often are beset with a substantial noise problem. Half of the population are males \"singing\" or calling for the females. The annoyance from the singing is tempered by the fact that the periodical cicadas are only out for 4-6 weeks once every 17 years, but they can occur more frequently where broods overlap.,   <b>Red Columbine</b> ,  <i>(Aquilegia formosa)</i> Flower May-August.

Prior to that time boys and girls paid to attend private academies. The county was divided into 27 districts and school commissioners were instructed to build a school house in each district. Schools in Jefferson County remained segregated until the 1960s.<p> The Charles Town School District built a single story stone school on the northwest corner of Charles and North Streets. As enrollment increased the building was expanded to include a second story.<p> By the 1890s the school on North Street was not large enough. In 1893 the commissioners purchased the building which had formerly been headquarters for the Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing and Improvement Company. Located on the northwest corner of Mildred Street and Third Avenue, Charles Town Graded School provided needed additional space for the growing student body. Wright Denny from Amelia County, Virginia, was appointed as a teaching principal.<p> In 1912 Charles Town Graded School moved to a newly constructed building.

Hurley was appointed principal.<p> The student body soon outgrew the Timberlake house and discussion for a new school was initiated. The need became more urgent when a state official gave the existing school a low rating until both an adequate library and appropriate laboratory space were provided. A bond issue to build a new high school was overwhelmingly passed in 1928. The Timberlake house was demolished, and the new Charles Town High School opened on the same site in the fall of 1929.<p> In 1939, after 47 years of service, Principal Wright Denny retired and Charles Town Graded School was renamed Wright Denny Elementary School in his honor. In 1959 a new high school was built east of town on High Street, and the old high school building became Charles Town Junior High School<p> The closing chapter for these buildings was written in 1972.

The Henry Clay Iron Furnace was the fiery heart fueling this small community, and reminds us of our historic connection to this landscape.,   Furnaces like this were built near the resources needed to produce iron: trees, iron ore, limestone, and water. This furnace was literally a hotbed of activity - it operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, producing about 4 tons of iron every day of the year during its short lifespan (from about 1834 - 1847). Intense heat would have radiated out, charcoal smoke would have lingered throughout the community, and the glow from the furnace would have been visible at night for some distance. Few large trees would be visible, having been cut down to fuel the furnace. Everyone - men, women, even older children - would have worked to keep the furnace and community alive.,   <b>The Fire Goes Out</b> ,   This iron producing region boomed in the early 1800s, but by 1849 was declining rapidly. Transportation was difficult and costly because iron had to be shipped down rivers. Competition had also increased from other iron producing regions in the U.S. About 100 homes, a school, store, church, and more were here - but can you see any evidence of them?

Historically, this space has been used for everything from a Reading Room and doctor's office to the American Legion hall.,   On the first floor there are nine individual bathing chambers with tubs that hold 750 gallons of spring water heated to 102 degrees and open to the public daily year round. The Federal style brick Roman Bath House was built in 1815 on the site of an earlier bathhouse often attributed to James Rumsey. The original built in 1784, was described as having five bathing chambers and dressing rooms. , From the 18th century into the 20th, the main entrance by road to the park and springs was along Wilkes Street to the Roman Bath House rather than along Washington Street and today's park \"front.\",   <b>About the Water</b> ,  The warm mineral waters are available for bathing in two park bathhouses; for drinking from a fountain at the 19th century Gentlemen's Spring House, and from every tap in town since the springs serve as source of the municipal water supply. Berkeley Springs water is also commercially bottled. , The water flows through the Oriskany sandstone of Warm Springs Ridge and out along its base at 74 degrees Fahrenheit. Dominated by sulphates, nitrates and carbonates - mostly magnesium carbonate - the water has a fresh, clean taste. Flow varies from 750 to 2000 gallons per minute. Since the 1750s it has been taken internally for digestive disorders and in baths for stress relief. , <i>I think myself benefitted from the water and am not without hope of their making a cure for me - a little time will show now.</i> , George Washington to Reverend Charles Green - August 30, 1761 , Left side bar describes and maps the Washington Heritage Trail."},{"id":117307,"title":"Berkeley Springs State Park","pos":[39.62656,-78.22872],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=117307","desc":"Berkeley Springs State Park. Washington Heritage Trail. Today's 4.5-acre Berkeley Springs State Park has always been public ground. Native tribes were known to use the springs but none called it home. Colonial owner Thomas Lord Fairfax allowed its public use. When the town was established in 1776, the area directly around the springs was retained for public use, called Bath Square and administered by Trustees.,   During the 19th century, the public area was called the Grove thanks to an abundance of large oaks that framed the Promenade where visitors strolled along the springs. Under direct control of the state for most of the 20th century, it became Berkeley Springs State Park in 1970 and was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places.,   The buildings and monuments reflect both the eternal purpose of the area ,  \"taking the waters\" ,  and the changing fashion of meeting that purpose over the centuries.,   Warm Springs Run is a mountain stream that joins with springs overflow under Fairfax Street and eventually wends its way north through town to the Potomac River.,   After 1784 a Gentlemen's Bath House was built on the site of today's Roman Baths. Local legend attributes its design to steamboat inventor James Rumsey. The present two-story brick structure was constructed about 1815. Original colors of yellow, cream and green are now used throughout the park. Since 1984, the Museum of Berkeley Springs has been located on the second floor.,   The Gentlemen's Spring House on pillars over the main drinking spring could date to 1816. An 1853 account describes today's structure exactly. There has been a public drinking spring or fountain in this location since 1787. The water has always been free to the public, a right enshrined by the Virginia Legislature in the 1776 law establishing a town at the springs.,   Several springs are sourced in the area south of the drinking spring, filling stone pools and a spillway, the largest public display of water among all the springs that line the Blue Ridge.,   The public swimming pool was built in 1951 on the site that held covered bathing pools in the previous two centuries. The Victorian pool building demolished in 1948 was a single 150-foot-long structure designed and built by Henry Harrison Hunter in 1887 while he was Park Superintendent. It was divided into two pools, one for each gender.,   George Washington's Bathtub is a modern stone reconstruction of the primitive conditions prior to 1784 where early bathers including Washington and hundreds of other summer visitors, soaked in springs-filled pools hollowed out from the natural terrain of the sandy hillside. The spring enclosed here has the highest elevation of any in the park.,   Lord Fairfax's spring is hugged by rocks as it empties into the southernmost pool. Up to the 1850s there was a rough shanty over it, allegedly built by Fairfax who always reserved a spring for his own use. This spring provided water to the succession of covered bath houses and now to the outdoor pool.,   The yellow brick Main Bathhouse at the south end of the park was built in 1929 on land added after the Berkeley Hotel burned in 1898. Massages have been given here since at least 1932.,   The gazebo on the eastern side of the run was dedicated in 1931.,   Converted to rest rooms and an office in 1930, the small brick building was once frame and described in 1787 as a Poor People's Bath. The original structure was attributed to James Rumsey.,   <i>We this day call d to see y. Fam d Warm Springs.

Washington Heritage Trail.  ,  For more than 200 years, the area bordering the park and springs on which the Country Inn stands, has been the historic spa town's center of hospitality.,   In September 1784, George Washington stayed at Sign of the Liberty Pole and Flag located just south of today's inn. There, the nation's most famous man met inventor and sawmill owner, James Rumsey, who demonstrated his mechanical boat to Washington.,   One of the ten lots occupied by the Country Inn was owned by James Smith, Signer of the Declaration of Independence from Pennsylvania; another by General Horatio Gates who witnessed Rumsey's successful public steamboat trial in Shepherdstown in 1787.,   In the prosperous decades before the Civil War, the Strother family built the elaborate Berkeley Springs Hotel facing onto the park. Soon after, President James K. Polk stayed there. When Confederate General Stonewall Jackson spent two days in January 1862 shelling Hancock, Maryland, he quartered his men and horses in the grand hotel; the Strothers were well-known Union supporters.,   Famous for its dress balls and band music, the Berkeley Springs Hotel continued as a mainstay of the resort town until March 1898 when it burned. After three decades of rumors and false starts by various investors, the local Harmison family built the current center section in 1933 as the Park View Inn. It became so popular, two wings were added in 1937 and more famous guests came to stay. New owners in 1972 named it the Country Inn, a name the current owners restored.,   The tiny lodging place known as Bath Cottage, south of the Inn, was built in the 1990s on the foundation of the cabin where 19th century bathkeeper, John Davis, was born and lived.

Washington Heritage Trail.  ,  In 1885, noted Maryland businessman, Colonel Samuel Taylor Suit began construction on the elaborate summer cottage now known as Berkeley Castle. The land was part of the original Fruit Hill Farm owned before the Civil War by John Strother of the Berkeley Springs Hotel.,   Made of local sandstone, the structure with its stone parapets and three-story turret reportedly gave the townspeople <i>the impression of a handsome castle nestled among the rocks and cliffs of the mountain.</i> It was one of more than two dozen splendid structures in the chic \"cottage\" community of Berkeley Springs during this Victorian Golden Age.,   Suit had married Rosa Pelham, daughter of an Alabama Congressman and 30 years his junior two years before starting the castle for her. In August 1887, he and Rosa took up residence with their three young children. A year later Suit was dead after a brief illness.,   Rosa spent the next decade hosting elaborate parties making good use of the castle's great hall with matching fireplaces, majestic stairway and lush wood-paneled formal dining room. In 1893, she built a tower-shaped carriage house connected to the main structure by winding tunnels blasted through the rough, natural rock of the mountainside. When WV9 was built in the 1920s, cutting the tower off from the main structure, the tunnel under the road collapsed.,   After Rosa vacated her castle, it went through decades of haphazard uses from tea room and artist retreat to site of the Monte Vista Boys Camp. Berkeley Castle became a prime tourism attraction for nearly half a century when Walter Bird purchased it in 1954 and began conducting house tours and spinning tall tales about its history. Eventually it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Unsubstantiated rumors that the castle is haunted persist.,   Another baseless legend is that Berkeley Castle is a half scale replica of the famed castle of that name near Bath, England. Thanks to the Internet, it is easy to see that the local Berkeley Castle is about 1/10th the size of the one in England and is more a design by someone who may have seen a castle in a book once rather than a replica of anything.,   Calculating the numbers, there are currently eight fireplaces, 16 room, nine full bathrooms and three halves as well as a kitchen on every floor.

Palatinate Germans, called Dutch from the translation of Deutsch, migrated south to Berkeley Springs from Pennsylvania. Lots 1 and 2 of the original town plat were set aside by the trustees in 1777 for a German church and two other houses. There is no indication that any structures were built. It was variously known as the Dutch, German or Lutheran Cemetery.,   Dr. Samuel Crawford was accused of poisoning and lynched in 1876. He was buried at the Dutch Cemetery and his ghost was reportedly seen standing over his grave in 1888.,   In 1995, the Foxglove Garden Club restored the cemetery and dedicated three Revolutionary War soldiers' graves: Solomon Smith, Frederick Duckwall and Frederick Duckwall Jr.,   The brick building perched on the hill overlooking the cemetery was originally constructed as Bath District High School in 1918 on the grounds of Mt.

George Washington supervised the construction of Fort Hedges, a stockade fort built along the Warm Spring Road at the heavily-traveled Skinner's gap atop North Mountain (740 feet elevation). The town, laid out by Josiah Hedges in 1832, and established by the Virginia General Assembly in 1836, is a collection of historic original log cabin buildings that primarily date from the town's establishment to the Civil War era.,   A natural limestone spring, which had been an Indian meeting place before the arrival of the European settlers, provided water for the entire village and reportedly has never been effected by draught. A law passed in the village's early days made it unlawful to <i>\"sit or loiter about the Town Spring drinking spirits.\"</i> The little village was much crossed by invading armies of both the North and the South in the Civil War.,   A mile east of the village the Battle of North Mountain was fought, it resulted in the capture of 1,500 Union soldiers who were marched into the south to prisoner of war camps.,   The picturesque brick building is oldest Episcopal Church in the county, Mt. Zion Episcopal Church (1818) predates the establishment of the town, and replaced an even earlier meeting house where George Washington, while a young man and a surveyor, occasionally worshipped. It is the burial site of many members of the Hedges family. John Marshall, a founding member of the U.S. Supreme Court, had a sister who likewise attended the church.,   <b>Snodgrass Tavern</b> ,  Snodgrass Tavern, one of the oldest known buildings in West Virginia (1742) is located on the east side of Back Creek along the well used Warm Springs Road (WV9). In the early 1800s, Robert Snodgrass also operated a ferry over Back Creek. The tavern was apparently a common entertainment spot and in 1828 he was reprimanded by local Presbyterians for allowing dancing. A store was established at the tavern in 1832 and in 1847 the house ceased to operate as a tavern. Dr. Joseph E. Snodgrass (1813-1884) grew up at the Tavern and later moved to Baltimore where he was a Doctor and aspiring writer. He and Edgar Allen Poe became close friends and colleagues.,   The tavern's most famous guest was George Washington. In 1769, while on his way to Warm Springs with his young stepdaughter, George Washington stopped at the inn and recorded in his diary: <i>\"...bated at one Snodgrasses and dined there, 7s, 6d. Lodgings cost 11d.\"</i> A story was handed down in the Snodgrass family that a servant dropped Washington's trunk while carrying it across Back Creek soaking the fine clothes it contained. Washington, a fastidious man, refused to come to the dining room without a change of apparel and ordered his dinner served in his room while the careless servant dried his clothes by the kitchen fire. During another journey on September 8, 1794, President Washington wrote in his diary, <i>\"Dispatched my wagon (with the baggage) at daylight and at 7 o'clock followed it.

Within a week in the Shepherdstown area, Stephenson had raised 98 men. These riflemen were the first continental or regular troops of the rebelling colonies.

On 17 July, Stephenson's company rallied at Morgan's Spring and began the 600-mile beeline march to Cambridge. Covering the distance in 25 days, they arrived at Cambridge on 11 August. Before the Revolution ended in 1783, seven companies from the Shepherdstown area had served in the war. About 100 soldiers were from the town.

The area's underlying limestone bedrock forms a red clay topsoil conductive to the growth of apples, pears, peaches, and cherries, and provided the incentive for area farmers to begin pursuing small-scale fruit production after the Civil War. Prior to 1890, orchard production was very limited with only about 3 to 6 acres devoted to orchards. Jefferson County focused on apples and, to a lesser extent, sour cherries while Berkeley County specialized in apples and peaches.,   As production increased around the turn of the 20th century; small family farms started to give way to larger commercially-operated orchard. As a result, regional farmers were able to re-establish a prominent position in the Eastern marketplace after experiencing a decline fueled by fierce competition from Midwestern grain producers and cattle ranchers.,   Following the local shift from cattle and grain agriculture to fruit production, the Hockensmith property was converted from probably cattle industry to use a fruit storage facility and apple evaporating plant. From its Bardane location, the dehydrated apples were shipped to larger markets via the B&O Railroad.

Washington Heritage Trail.  ,  At Bunker Hill in 1726, Colonel Morgan Morgan founded the first permanent settlement of record in what is now West Virginia.

Morgan Morgan's descendants founded Morgantown.,  Morgan's Chapel in Bunker Hill, one of the first places of worship in Berkeley County, was erected in 1740 by Colonel Morgan. The current building, constructed in 1852, is the third built on the site. Evidence indicates that the church was used as a makeshift fort during the Civil War, and areas of the walls sustained damage from artillery fire. The holes in the walls are still visible, and writings and drawings dating back to the Civil War are further proof of occupation by both Union and Confederate soldiers.,  Morgan Morgan built his cabin between 1731 and 1734.

From Rails to Trails. The rail-trail you are standing on today exists not only because trains because trains rumbled through here in the past, but because this corridor may be needed for trains in the future. In 1983, the U.S. Congress amended the National Trails System Act due to concern about the rapid disappearance of America's rail network. Railroad corridors can become rail-trails through a legislative process called railbanking when rail transportation is no longer needed. Although a railroad company no longer owns the corridor, the property is legally protected for return to railroad service is trains are needed in the future to transport goods or people.,   The Fairmont, Morgantown, and Pittsburgh Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio (B&O) Railroad (now the Mon River Trail) was built in the late 1880s primarily to transport the high-quality bituminous coal found throughout North Central West Virginia. The Mon River and Deckers Creek Rail-Trails were once the region's busiest highways. Their trains carried coal, coke (produced from coal used to make iron), sand for glass-making, limestone, and other items to distant markets in Pittsburgh and beyond. Remnants of former railroad structures such as signal boxes, trestles, and telegraph poles, as well as homestead foundations, mine portals, stone quarries, and coke ovens, are still evident in the landscape you pass on the trail.,   <small> <b>Working on a Rail-Trail</b> ,  In 1996, this 51-mile railroad corridor was acquired from CSX to be railbanked as a non-motorized trail system thanks to the joint efforts of the nonprofit Mon River Trails Conservancy and the city of Morgantown. In 2006, the Mon River and Deckers Creek Rail-Trail System was designated as a National Recreation Trail for its exemplary qualities.,   Become a Mon River Trails Conservancy (MRTC) member and help the rail-trails! MRTC manages these trails primarily for walking, jogging, cycling, and cross-country skiing.

Possibly named after the nearby Big Buffalo Creek, the town was from its beginnings inextricably tied to river trade and to agriculture. In its early days, many of the town�s inhabitants earned a living as captains and crewmen aboard river vessels that plied the length of the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers. Using this water route, area farmers and craftsmen shipped their produce and wares to markets in other states.

A Microcosm.  ,  <b>A Microcosm</b> ,  Historians use the word microcosm as shorthand to show that a piece is representative of the whole. &#8220;A house divided against itself,&#8221; Putnam County sent approximately 10% of its population to war, nearly half to each army. Civilians experienced the privations of war: occupation, theft, and loss. Soldiers had family in the opposing army and their units met on the battlefield. They endured boredom, fighting, imprisonment, and the death of those surrounding them. The wartime experiences of soldiers and civilians in Putnam County are an apt representation of the experiences of soldiers and civilians throughout the nation during the Civil War. ,  <b>The Worst of War: Guerillas and Prison</b> ,  Putnam County experienced extensive guerilla warfare even though it did not witness any major battles. Rather than fighting battles, these partisan rangers conducted raids, foraged from civilians, attacked at night, captured boats, and burned bridges. Their goal was to strike quickly and leave. If not enlisted as regular soldiers, many of these activities were illegal. In an 1862 effort to spare captured partisans from execution and make them Confederate soldiers, Virginia Governor John Letcher declared &#8220;the loyal citizens in Western Virginia are earnestly invoked to form guerilla companies and strike when least expected for the state that gave them birth.&#8221; Frequently, these actions disguised crimes as warfare and became civilians� worst experiences. ,  Many soldiers found their worst experiences in prison camps. Neither army was prepared to take prisoners, house, care, or feed them. Prisons were often makeshift, sanitation was lacking, and food was scarce. 15% of Union soldiers and 12% of Confederate soldiers who became prisoners of war died in prison, a rate of death higher than any battlefield. Yet some men, like Samuel A. Sterret  managed to survive both the battlefields and the prisons. ,  <b>Buffalo: Recruits for both armies</b> ,  Lt. Col. John McCausland established camp at the Buffalo Academy and recruited Confederate soldiers at Buffalo from May to June 1861 including the Buffalo Guards which became Company A, 36th Virginia. After his retreat, the Union army established a camp at Buffalo and recruited the 7th WV Cavalry. Sterret, Fife, Bias, and Reynolds, each began his Civil War experience there. ,  <b>Skirmish at Hurricane Bridge</b> ,  In the spring of 1863, Col. Albert G. Jenkins raided the Kanawha Valley with 800 soldiers to capture a supply depot and horses at Point Pleasant. Near the current junction of US 60 and WV 34, he found 400 soldiers of the 11th and 13th West Virginia. Jenkins demanded the surrender of the Union forces, who refused. Confederate soldiers opened fire from a distance to avoid taking casualties. Fighting lasted five hours until Jenkins withdrew and proceeded to Point Pleasant. The Federal force was not captured and the Confederate force was not defeated resulting in a draw. ,  <b>The Brothers� War</b> ,  The American Civil War divided families just as it divided a nation. Of the 602 soldiers whose roots can be traced to Putnam County, 311 (51.7%) joined the Confederacy while 291 (48.3%) joined the Union. ,  A family slave named Ned saved George Washington Smith�s life as a young boy. Remembering Ned, George decided that he could not fight for slavery even though his brothers, William and John, joined the Confederacy serving with the 2nd Virginia Cavalry. George joined Company K of the 13th West Virginia Infantry fighting with Philip Sheridan in, the Shenandoah Valley. ,  George�s war did not end in 1865. His mother welcomed him home, but it took years to fully reconcile with his family. Undoubtedly each soldier from Putnam County personally knew someone wearing the other uniform, and many called that other man brother, father, or son. Some even shot at him during battle. ,  <b>Battle of Atkeson Gate (Battle of Buffalo)</b> ,  In the fall of 1862, Confederate forces camped on multiple farms in the Buffalo area below (north) and above (south) of the Atkeson farm. On September 26, 1862, the 91st Ohio under Col. John A. Tinley engaged the 16th Virginia Cavalry under Maj. James H. Nounnan. Nounann�s split forces merged on the Atkeson farm, where the family witnessed fighting along the turnpike approximately 100 yards from their front door. Years  later, the young Atkeson boy who witnessed the battle claimed there were no casualties. His 16 or 47 year old sister, Samantha, painted the battle from memory just a few days later. The figure on horseback in the center is believed to be Maj. James H. Nounnan, and if so, is probably the only wartime image of him. ,  <b>Battle of Scary Creek</b> ,  On July 17, 1861, 900 Confederate soldiers under Col. George S. Patton attempted to stop the advance of 1500 Union soldiers under Col. John Lowe. Soldiers on both sides experienced the chaos of their first battle. Eventually, Union soldiers retreated and Confederate soldiers then captured several Union officers. The tactical Confederate victory was short lived as the Confederacy  evacuated Charleston a week later. ,  <b>Units Putnam County Soldiers Served In</b> ,  Union: 3rd West Virginia Cavalry . 5th West Virginia Cavalry . 7th West Virginia Cavalry . 11th West Virginia Infantry . 13th West Virginia Infantry . 181st Militia . ,  Confederate: 2nd Virginia Cavalry . 8th Virginia Cavalry . 16th Virginia Cavalry . 22nd Virginia Infantry . 36th Virginia Infantry . 36th Battalion Virginia Cavalry ,  <b>Battles Putnam County Soldiers Fought In</b> ,  Union: Cheat Mountain, McDowell, Cross Keys, Cedar Mountain, 2nd Bull Run, Droop Mountain, Shenandoah Valley operations, Port Republic, Averill's Raids, Cloyd's Mountain, Kernstown, Berryville, Opequan, Cedar Creek, Hatcher's Run, Petersburg, Appomattox. ,  Confederate: Scary Creek, Western Virginia operations, eastern Tennessee operations, Shenandoah operations, Carnifex Ferry, Cross Lanes, Cloyd's Mountain, Piedmont, Waynesborough, Fort Donelson, Gettysburg, Droop Mountain, Appomattox. ,  <b>Civilians Experience War</b> ,  Putnam County civilians took sides as they sent Emily into each army. 19 year old Sarah. Francis Young wrote, &#8220;It is my birthday. And oh! What may transpire before my next. Our country is in danger of Civil War and it makes me shudder to think of it. May our blessed Union be preserved in spite of traitors.&#8221; Within a few months, her father enlisted. ,  The presence of an enemy army or partisan rangers meant that civilians of every allegiance endured occupation and occasionally they were refugeed. When Confederate soldiers left Buffalo, including her brother, Virginia Hansford wrote, &#8220;Then came the question, what should I take and what should I leave. I could take very little, and necessarily it was mostly clothing. ... These are the times that tried women�s hearts, but I had to be brave and strong, and never a tear did I shed, Had I been allowed to stay I would have done so, but everyone had refugeed.&#8221; ,  The most frequent interaction between civilians and soldiers was foraging (stealing). The laws of war allowed soldiers, under the direction of officers; to take anything of use to the army from civilians in exchange for a receipt. Such receipts were utterly worthless when written by the opposing army and even loyal citizens found their own armies reluctant to pay. A soldier in the 34th Ohio recorded &#8220;Having failed to find any armed rebels, the Zouaves decided to do the next best thing, which was, in their opinion, to get chickens for supper. The poor feathered tribe was doomed to a fearful end. More than a thousand of them were sacrificed to appease the stomachs made hungry by a fatiguing march.&#8221; ,  <b>Skirmish at Winfield</b> , \t Seeking to control Red House Shoals, Capt. Phillip J. Thurmond and a band of 400 partisan rangers attacked Capt. John M. Reynolds 80 man Company D of the 7th WV Cavalry at 3 a.m. on October 26, 1864. The raid resulted in nothing but noise until Thurmond was mortally wounded an hour into the fight. He was buried near the original location of Judge Hoge�s house (300 yards north). In 2010, the body was relocated to the present site of Judge Hoge�s house. The skirmish was a Union victory as it resulted in the death of a partisan leader and prevented the capture of the shoals. ,  <b>Capturing A General</b> ,  Union General Eliakim P. Scammon directed the steamboat Levi to take him from Point Pleasant to Charleston on the night of February 2, 1864. The captain advised waiting until morning to leave because the boat could not pass Red House Shoals at night, but the general insisted on moving quickly. Confederate Major James H. Nounnan learned of the steamboat�s presence at 3 a.m. on the 3rd when he entered Winfield. He directed a lieutenant and 12 men to board the Levi which led to Scammon�s capture along with medical supplies, weapons, several other soldiers, and the eventual destruction of the boat. The West Virginia Herald complained, &#8220;We hope our General who succeeds Scammon will go down and view the country and see the necessity of troops at Hurricane to prevent another raid soon. Troops at Winfield are no protection to the Union citizens of Putnam or Mason county.&#8221; ,  <b>Divided In Peace: When Did the Civil War End?</b> ,  Lee�s surrender on April 9, 1865 marked the beginning of the end. Officially, the American Civil War ended on August 20, 1866 with President Johnson�s statement &#8220;that peace, order, tranquility, and civil authority now exist in and throughout the whole of the United States of America.&#8221; In reality, daily life was far more complicated, especially in the closely divided state of West Virginia. On May 24, 1866 the West Virginia legislature passed a law stating &#8220;No person who ... has given or shall give voluntary aid or assistance to the rebellion against the United States, shall be a citizen of this state, or be allowed to vote...&#8221; For five years, West Virginia made a distinction between Union citizens and former Confederates as non-citizens. On April 17, 1871 West Virginians passed the Flick Amendment guaranteeing black West Virginians the right to vote. A rider on the amendment also allowed ex-Confederates to vote and again be citizens."},{"id":137358,"title":"Raiders in Buffalo","pos":[38.61741,-81.98046],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=137358","desc":"Raiders in Buffalo.

From Salt Sulphur Springs he rode along the Tygart and Buckhannon Rivers, taking 5,000 weapons in Buckhannon and occupying Weston. He captured the Union garrison at Spencer on Sept. 2 and then took Ripley, where he seized funds from the U.S. paymaster.

Instead, after driving in the Federal pickets, Jenkins recalled he &#8220;then proceeded with my main body towards Buffalo, a small town situated on the Kanawha 20 miles above its mouth.

On September 26, Col. John A. Turley, 91st Ohio Infantry, led his regiment downriver from Point Pleasant. Four miles north of here (a mile north of Eighteen Mile Creek) he encountered Jenkins�s cavalry pickets. After crossing the creek, Turley deployed his men in battle line on both sides of the road to Buffalo. Jenkins shelled the Federals from &#8220;near the bridge, at the lower end of the town,&#8221; but the rounds passed overhead. Turley, impeded by the &#8220;marshy ravine&#8221; behind the Methodist church and Buffalo Academy, pushed Jenkins�s troopers through the town. The Confederates scattered. Turley captured two, killed or wounded about ten, and took several rifles and horses. Turley regretted not getting to the town in time to capture Jenkins, &#8220;as he slept in a private residence in Buffalo on the night previous.&#8221; Jenkins was transferred to Virginia�s Shenandoah Valley in December. ,  <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  The Methodists were the first congregation in Buffalo.

An Important and Historical Water Trail Serving Man and Industry. The Coal River is a tributary of the Kanawha River in southern West Virginia. It is formed near the community of Alum Creek by the confluence of the Big and Little Coal Rivers. The Coal River flows generally northward through western Kanawha County, past the community of Tornado, and into the Kanawha River at St. Abans. ,  Originally named �Walhondecepe� by the Delaware Indians, the three rivers that make up the Coal River Watershed have served as a vital transportation link to the Kanawha giver. The Indians used the rivers as a favorite hunting and fishing site. ,  Since the first settlers came to the region the rivers have served not only as a river trail but as a source of fishing, recreation, drinking water, social life and an important site for baptisms. ,  The Big Coal River is formed near Whitesville where two streams, Clear Fork and Marsh Fork come together to create the Big Coal River. The tributaries begin in Raleigh County at an elevation of over 3,000 feet. The river flows generally northwest past the towns of Sylvester, Seth, Racine and Ashford, West Virginia. The region�s availability of large seams of cannel coal, which could be used to produce a very desirable coal oil, eventually replaced whale oil for lighting in the urban areas of the US, created. This was the first coal-based economic boom for the region. The Big Coal River, Little Coal River, and Coal River provided a river trail which was enhanced in the mid 1850�s by the construction of a 34 mile lock and dam system. The Coal River Navigation Company of Virginia originally invested $208,000 to complete the system. At its height over 800,000 bushels of coal were shipped annually. ,  Beginning around 1800, flax mills and gristmills were built and operated along the three Coal Rivers. The mills provided an important source for the production of textiles in addition to staples such as flour and cornmeal. ,  Lumber was harvested throughout the Coal River Watershed once the upper lock and dams had washed away. Transporting lumber from the upper reaches of the Watershed was a dangerous and difficult process requiring high water and large log rafts to transport the logs to sawmills throughout the region. Finished lumber mills proliferated in the St. Albans area during this period as did flour processors and broom and barrel manufacturers. ,  Coal mining throughout the watershed region began in the early 1800�s and continues today. The history of coal mining in the region is well documented and has defined the growth and development of the region. ,  The use of the river for transportation of coal changed dramatically after the construction of rail lines throughout the region. The rivers� role in the region once rail lines had been built was that of providing water for processing, cleaning and serving community needs for drinking water, fishing, recreation and sanitation. ,  River recreation and community social life have been centered on the Coal Rivers since the earliest settlers arrived in the region. The bountiful supply of fish, mussels, fresh water clams, crayfish, otter, beaver, muskrat, blue heron, duck, geese and other wildlife made the rivers a natural source of food for all residents. Baptisms were conducted in the rivers by ministers from the many churches located in the area. The rivers� winding path through the mountains naturally forms hundreds of sandy beach areas. The beaches were and remain the center of social events and regular recreational swimming activities for the local citizens. The utilization of the river as a center of recreation for the youth growing up in the region is the basis of the term &#8220;river rats&#8221; which locals embrace fondly. ,  <i>The information and pictures have been provided with permission from: Bill Dean, Author of </i>Coal Steamboats, Timber and Trains;<i> Coal River Group Collection: Boone County, WV Historical Photos: The Armstrong Funeral Home Collection: The Gilmer County Historical Society and The Sherman Tide Yearbook Collection.</i>"},{"id":137546,"title":"Upper Big Branch Mine Explosion","pos":[37.97942,-81.53414],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=137546","desc":"Upper Big Branch Mine Explosion. .  , <b>Following the footprint.</b> Every mine explosion leaves behind a footprint that offers clues to investigators as to where the blast originated and how the force traveled from the ignition point. The footprint left behind in the Upper Big Branch mine tells the story of an explosion that started with the ignition of a small amount of methane gas and then was fueled by coal dust that had been allowed to build up for miles through the mine. ,  <b>The Explosion.</b> As the shearer operator cut into the sandstone top of the longwall, the friction created sparks. Typically, when machinery cuts into coal, there is little sparking because the coal is soft. When shearer bits hit rock surrounding coal, sparks fly. On April 5, 2010, the sparks ignited a pocket of methane or natural gas that likely had risen from the floor or migrated from the gob ,  a previously mined area located behind the longwall. ,  Although the shearer was equipped with water sprays designed to douse the flame at the point of ignition, later testing found that the sprays on the shearer had been removed or were clogged, rendering them ineffective. The crew could do nothing to halt the propagation of the fireball as it ignited coal dust that had built up in the Tailgate 1 North area. As the flame propagated, it formed the shape of a wedge that grew to a massive slug that sped through the mine, up to the roof, and down to the floor. A series of explosions was created as the compressed air on the leading edge of the force caused the coal dust to become airborne. Thus, the explosion generated its own fuel with the air/dust mixture behaving like a line of gunpowder, carrying the blast forward in multiple directions, eventually reaching its strongest level at Headgate 22. ,  <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  When a mine explodes suddenly and with great force, as happened at Upper Big Branch, methane is immediately suspected as a primary source. Odorless, colorless, and  highly combustible, methane is the most common (naturally occurring) hazardous gas found in underground coal mines. ,  Methane explosions occur when a buildup of methane gas comes into contact with an ignition source, such as a flame or spark. Because sparking is common in the mining process, history is replete with Methane explosions. ,  Small methane ignitions do not have to turn into major explosions if mine operators adhere to basic safety measures, such as maintaining adequate ventilation systems, removing explosive coal dust from mining operations, spreading required amounts of rock dust, and ensuring that water sprays on mining equipment are kept in good repair and function properly. Because these basic safety systems failed at Upper Big Branch Mine, a minor flare-up of methane led to the nation�s worst coal mining disaster in 40 years."},{"id":137549,"title":"Upper Big Branch Mine Explosion","pos":[37.97941,-81.53412],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=137549","desc":"Upper Big Branch Mine Explosion.

He studied law and was admitted to the bar at age 20 in 1850, later moving to Winfield in 1852. Hoge wed Sarah Wright of Charleston on May 19, 1857 and the couple had 11 children, 8 of whom survived to adulthood. In the summer of 1882, Hoge suffered from a liver ailment which caused his death on August 12th at the young age of 52. ,  <b>&#8220;Few equals&#8221; ,  James Hoge and the Law</b> ,  Receiving a license to practice law before his 21st birthday, Hoge embarked on a prestigious legal career. He partnered with an experienced Charleston attorney to expand the practice into Mason County and the recently created Putnam County. After just a few years in his new home, Hoge was elected prosecuting attorney for the county, a position which he was re-elected to multiple times. In 1867, he was appointed to the 11th Circuit Court in West Virginia to fill a vacancy for a year and a half. Although some citizens opposed his politics, 42 lawyers  including men such as Quarrier, Laidley, Simms, Ruffner, Polsley, and Bowyer, published a letter describing Hoge as a man above partisanship and called for his election. Hoge graciously responded, &#8220;I am a candidate.&#8221; He was elected to a six year term in 1869, after which he returned to a private practice that spanned Putnam, Fayette, Clay,  Mason, Kanawha, and Cabell counties. Upon his death in 1882, the Putnam Democrat wrote &#8220;As a jury lawyer he had few equals, having the faculty of gaining confidence of the jury to an eminent degree. His memory was remarkably retentive, and this, with one of the best law libraries in the State. ... Judge Hoge was one of the kindest men, always ready to aid the widow and the fatherless by gratuitous legal advice and pecuniary assistance. He was a kind and indulgent father, and society at large will miss his presence and aid.&#8221; ,  <b>Hoge Cemetery</b> ,  Upon the death of Putnam County�s first clerk Hart Hills Forbes in 1856, James W. Hoge buried his brother-in-law in a newly created cemetery. Additional burials would include James and Sarah Hoge, 8 of their 11 children, Sarah�s parents, and one of James� brothers. Across the 1870s and 1880s, 7 of Dr. S. B. Thompson�s patients, including his wife and daughter, were buried in the cemetery. Mrs. Thompson�s death was listed as &#8220;a sore throat,&#8221; which may indicate a scarlet fever epidemic. There are at least 29 identified burials in the cemetery along with 8 grave depressions at the back of the cemetery. Those burials are a mystery and one hypothesis suggests that Hoge slaves may have been buried there in unmarked graves. ,  <b>North? South? Neutral?</b> ,  As the sole representative for Putnam County at the Virginia Secession Convention in April 1861, Judge Hoge voted against Virginia leaving the Union. After that vote passed, he left and did not further participate in the convention. Even though he had been commissioned in the Virginia Militia, Hoge did not serve the Confederacy nor did he participate in the formation of West Virginia or support the United States. He &#8220;gave us not one word of cheer or comfort,&#8221; wrote one citizen. Another called Hoge an &#8220;artful dodger&#8221; who rescued &#8220;some notorious rebels [civilians] from the custody of our Soldiers, who had been arrested for carrying rebel mail and giving information to the rebels.&#8221; After an 1864 skirmish in Winfield, the body of the only Confederate casualty was left with Hoge who had the young man properly buried expecting the family to claim the body shortly. Hoge had &#8220;southern sympathies&#8221; according to his grandson, but there is no clear evidence that James W. Hoge supported either side during the Civil War. He is best characterized as neutral. ,  <b>Judge Hoge�s Career</b> ,  . 1850: Admitted to the bar  , . 1855-1863: Private Practice with Andrew Parks  , . 1856-1867: Putnam County Prosecuting Attorney  , . 1859: Commissioned Colonel 181st Virginia Militia  , . 1861: Putnam County delegate to the Virginia Secession Convention  , . 1867-1868: Appointed 11th Circuit Court Judge  , . 1869-1874: Elected 11th Circuit Court Judge  , . 1870s: Putnam County Superintendent of Schools (exact dates unknown)  , . 1874-1882: Private Practice ,  <b>Historical Significance</b> ,  The Historic Hog House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the United States� official list of places worthy of historic preservation, for local significance. It derives significance from association with Judge James W. Hoge and as a vernacular example of Federalist architecture characterized by stepped side gables, interior chimneys, and a decorative brick cornice. ,  <b>The Historic Hoge House</b> ,  A single story brick house was built approximately 1000 feet from its current site in 1838 on Lot #8 in what would become Winfield, West Virginia. Charles Brown had the house built and his son Tallyrand Brown occupied it upon its completion. On May 22,1848 the first session of  the Putnam County Court was held in Tallyrand Brown�s house, now the Historic Hoge House. Charles Brown willed the house to Tallyrand Brown in 1849 who sold it to John Bowyer in 1852, Bower rented the premises to James W. Hoge in 1855 and sold it to him in 1857. Judge Hoge lived in this building for 25 years and his wife remained here for another 32 years. One of their daughters, known as Aunt Birdie, lived in the house until 1947 and the Hoge family owned the property until 2002; 145 years of ownership in the same family! ,  <b>Architectural Terms and Features</b> ,  .

The explosions ripped through the mines, causing the earth to shake as far as 8 miles away, shattering buildings and pavement, hurling people and horses violently to the ground, and knocking streetcars off their rails. In this, which remains the worst mine disaster in the United States, 362 men and boys died.  ,   The Monongah Mines Nos. 6 and 8 were located on the West Fork of the Monongahela River, about 6 miles south of the town of Fairmont, West Virginia. The mines were connected underground and were considered model mines, the most up-to-date in the mining industry. Electricity was used for coal-cutting machinery; locomotives were used to haul coal; and the largest areas of each mine were ventilated by mechanical fans.  ,  The Marion County Coroner�s Jury, after hearing from numerous witnesses, concluded the victims of the disaster died from an explosion caused by either a blown out shot or by ignition and explosion of blasting powder in Mine No. 8.

A large cloud of black smoke and red flames spewed from the pit opening, and rock and debris were catapulted from the mine.  ,  Twenty-one miners managed to scramble to safety, but another 78 men were not as fortunate. Attempts at rescue were delayed until the fires could be extinguished. For days afterward, rescuers from across the coalfields worked amidst the debris, some of it dangerously unstable, looking to find and dig out survivors.  ,  Finally, after nine days, the mine was ordered sealed, a step that had been delayed out of consideration of the relatives of men inside. The mine was reopened a year later and most of the bodies removed, although 19 miners were never recovered. The legal and political consequences were profound. Shocked by the Farmington carnage, a mine safety conference was convened in Washington to discuss working conditions in the nation�s coal mines. As a result of the disaster, national attention was brought to the issue of mine safety in late 1968 and early 1969. Congress and the Nixon administration responded with the passage of the 1969 federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act.  ,  <a href=http://www.wvencydopedia.org/artides/2241 target=_blank>http://www.wvencydopedia.org/artides/2241</a> ,  <b>2006 International Coal Group ,  Sago Coal Mine ,  Sago, West Virginia</b> ,  An explosion at the Sago mine in Upshur County, West Virginia, killed 12 men on January 2, 2006.

However, information from rescuers underground became scrambled by the time it reached the surface. Mining officials believed that they heard that all 12 miners had survived. ,  Gathered at the Sago Baptist Church nearby were family members who heard the erroneous information and celebrated the survival of their loved ones. News agencies picked up the story and spread it worldwide. Three hours later, mining officials announced that 11 men were dead. Only one miner survived the disaster.

September 12, 1861. <b>War comes to the Big Coal River.</b> Emboldened by a resounding victory against Confederates at Boone Court House (Madison), Union General Cox ordered Federal troops back into the Coal River Valley. This time the target was the Big Coal River. ,  The Battle of Boone Court House resulted in the destruction of the Confederate garrison and burning of the county seat. It left the region generally in the contested control of Federals and their Unionist militia allies. Since there was no large body of Confederate troops organizing or operating in the Big Coal Country, it seems that the objective was primarily to brutalize the citizenry who were loyal to the South in order to deter their enthusiasm for supporting the rebellion. ,  In early September, a wagon train defended by a battalion of five companies of Union infantry from the First Kentucky Infantry Regiment and a section of light artillery, about 500 men, k departed Brownstown (Marmet) and joined up with Peytona Home Guard at the mouth of Short Creek. Marching southward along Coal River Road (present day State Route 3), Union Captain David Y. Johns and his battalion of soldiers ravaged Boone and Raleigh counties sacking many homesteads along the way. This bold move directly threatened Raleigh Court House (Beckley), and when General Wise learned of the Federals tearing up the Big Coal region he immediately selected a force of cavalry and hastened the Confederates to intercept the Raiders. Wise dispatched six companies of Southern cavalry under Colonel James Lucius Davis. It was a fast-moving formidable cavalry force from which Wise expected significant results. ,  Davis arrived at Raleigh Court House (Beckley) with 240 Rebel cavalry and after learning the Federals were at work raiding along the Boone-Raleigh frontier, he spurred his cavalry force forward to close with the enemy before they were across Lens Creek Mountain and safe from pursuit. ,  <b>3:00 AM, September 12th, 1861.</b> After hard-riding in a steady rain, over steep mountain trails and multiple river crossings, Davis and his mounted force arrived in Jarrolds Valley (Whitesville). There he learned that Federals had pillaged and sacked Pack�s plantation, were stealing cattle and were camped there about two miles away at present-day Sylvester, then called Pack�s Branch or Lower Round Bottom. Augustus Pack was an affluent landowner and was Boone County�s second-largest individual slaveholder. The Packs were one of the Coal River Valley�s most Confederate families. They gave food and supplies to the Confederate Army, had several family members in the Confederate service and therefore were targets of Union attention. Colonel Davis immediately sent scouts to speak with local residents to assess the number of Northern troops at Lower Round Bottom and upon their return learned the Confederate cavalrymen would be outnumbered by more than two to one. Undeterred by the size of the Union force and the pouring rain, Davis and his Rebel cavalry began the two-mile ride to Lower Round Bottom. ,  <b>Daybreak, September 12th, 1861.</b> Upon arrival at Pack�s, the Confederate Cavalrymen discovered that the Union wagon train and guard had withdrawn the previous afternoon after plundering Lower Round Bottom and were marching back to the Federal Camp at Brownstown (Marmet). The Confederate cavalry commander immediately ordered his men in pursuit and divided his small force in two. Davis held two companies back in reserve with him and sent four companies racing ahead to chase down and overtake the Federals on Coal River Road. ,  <b>Late Afternoon, September 12th, 1861.</b> After twelve miles at full gallop, the Confederates came upon Federal stragglers near Coon�s Mill (Seth). They learned the Federal force had camped there and were not far ahead. Though exhausted, the opportunity to cut off and capture the Union force raised the hopes of the Confederate cavalrymen. Command promptly ordered the company that appeared to be in the best condition to detach from the main column at Coon�s Mill to prevent the Federals from escaping and to attack their rear. ,  <b>Evening, September 12th, 1861.</b> After a few more miles at full gallop, splashing through the Big Coal�s creeks, the forward element of the Confederate cavalry came upon the Federals establishing camp for the evening on the broad plain at the mouth of Joe�s Creek on the right bank of the Big Coal River, about two and a half miles southeast of the mouth of Short Creek. The Union infantry were posted in an apple orchard and an open riverside field, ground suitable for cavalry action. From the disposition of the Federals, it appeared that they were unmindful of the Rebels� presence. In addition to the battalion of soldiers, there were seventeen civilian prisoners, cattle, horses, mules and wagons loaded with corn and other plunder raided from homesteads and communities up and down the Big Coal. The long line of wagons stretched toward Brownstown (Marmet), making snail-like progress along the narrow Coat River Road. ,  <b>Battle Begins, September 12th, 1861.</b> A few hours of daylight remained and if the Confederate cavalry attacked with supreme effort, they might block the Union force�s return to the Kanawha, sever it from General Cox's army, and capture or disperse it. The forward element of cavalry drove into the Federal encampment, choosing to attack immediately instead of waiting on the rest of the force to arrive. The purpose of the lightning strike was to shock and scatter the surprised Federal troops. Nothing could withstand the charge of the Confederate cavalry pushing into the Yankee camp with swords drawn and firing from their horses, sixty Confederate cavalry against nearly 500 Federal troops. ,  During the early part of the battle the surprised Federals held their ground and tried to make a stand in the orchard and field but it was only temporary. The volume of fire and a thunderous charge surged towards the Union line. The charge was daring, spectacular and devastating. The Rebel horseman went in on the gallop, sabers swinging, the cavalry shouting the Rebel Yell scattered the line leaving the ground covered with the dead and dying. The ensuing fight was severe with instances of hand-to-hand combat as riflemen swung their weapons as war clubs with death-dealing effect. ,  The initial attack was so violent and sudden that the Federal infantry was routed within fifteen minutes, falling back in a confused and broken mass fleeing into the surrounding mountains leaving their plunder behind. Once the Union lines were broken the retreat became a rout, which continued for three miles down the Big Coal River Valley. In the three-hour running action, the remainder of the follow on Confederate companies rushed into the action as they arrived on scene. The battle moved from field to field along the Coal River Road to the mouth of Toney�s Branch (Bloomingrose) where the Confederates finally completely overtook the remainder of the Federal troops driving them into the mountains. The cavalry made a final charge on the town of Peytona but was repulsed by a Company of retreating Federal troops bolstered by a squad of Peytona Home Guard. The retreat was not pressed further by the Confederates as they were exhausted after riding continuously for more than 24 hours. ,  Casualties for the battle vary widely from five Union troops killed up to as many as fifty killed and wounded. The defeat was nevertheless stunning for the Federals because the equivalent of a company was captured. The troops captured were sent to the notorious Libby Prison in Richmond where they suffered terribly. ,  The Confederate victors found themselves with the entire train, fifty to sixty horses and mules, government and private wagons along with goods stolen from residents of the Big Coal River Valley and the freed political prisoners including the Pack family and slaves. The Confederates suffered no casualties or captured. ,  The Battle of Coal River was one of the first dramatic cavalry actions of the war anywhere, and its news excited attention in the South, especially in Richmond. It avenged the burning of Boone Court House and embarrassed General Cox and the Federal troops camped at Charleston. ,  <b>Union Forced Involved:</b> <i> First Kentucky Infantry Regiment</i> Company B, Capt.

Captive Journey!. The War for Empire during the 1750s (often called the French and Indian War) was a contest between France, England, and several American Indian Nations to control much of eastern North America, especially the Ohio River Watershed. This rich region supported abundant animal populations, fertile soils, and well-timbered mountainsides. It is no wonder that when British colonial expansion into the region threatened the livelihoods of some Ohio Valley Indian Nations, some anti-British factions of those Peoples allied themselves to the French, who had determined to keep the British Empire east of the Allegheny Mountains. ,  The war visited the Draper�s Meadow settlement (present-day Blacksburg, VA) in 1755 and the Draper and Ingles families were changed forever. Young wife and mother Mary Ingles (nee Draper) became a casualty of war. A French-allied Shawnee war party attacked her frontier home and those of her neighbors on and about July 30, 1755. Her mother-in-law and her sister-in-law�s baby were killed. Betty Draper, Mary�s sister-in-law was wounded. Mary and her two boys were safe, but their long ordeal was just beginning. Adding one more prisoner, Henry Lenard, to the captive party, the warriors prodded them down New River to Bluestone River, then up that stream a short ways before ascending the dominant massif known as Flat Top Mountain. Once on Flat Top, the party made its way past the Great Glade (near where Winterplace resort is located today) and onward to the &#8220;Painted Trees&#8221; (war camps) on Paint Creek. The larger of the war camps was located just a little ways upstream of this roadside park, and its painted trees served as records of military exploits undertaken during previous wars engaged in between northern and southern Indian Nations. Undoubtedly, the leader of Mary�s captors left his record here, showing several headless stick figures representing their dead and scalped enemies, as well as two women, two boys, and one man, perhaps collared with a prisoner cord. These prisoners, especially the women and children, were prizes worth much more than scalps. ,  Eventually, the foot-weary party would reach the Ohio Shawnee towns, but first they had to travel the Paint Creek Trail to access the larger trail through the Kanawha Valley. The going was rocky in spots, with numerous stream crossings. Food and medicines were gathered along the way. A crayfish hole here a blackberry patch there, provided the minimal sustenance the party needed to move fast down Paint Creek in hopes of avoiding a militia posse from the Virginia settlements. There was plenty of clean water to drink along the way, no coal mines, no sewer outfalls, no timber haul roads, no carelessly tossed garbage to taint the springs and branches. ,  Once the party made it to Sonhioto (present day Portsmouth OH), Mary�s sons were taken from her and adopted into Shawnee families. Betty and Henry were taken to other communities. Soon Mary found herself working for a French trader, making shirts for his clientele. She was befriended by an elderly woman and soon they had plans to escape. While rendering salt at Big Bone Lick in KY, they made their move. Over a life-threatening journey of around 500 miles, the two women returned to the Virginia New River settlements in the Fall, where Mary was united with the remnants of her family. Soon she helped her husband, Will, and her brother, Johnny, to plan to ransom her boys and sister-in-law. Two-year old Georgie could not be found, but Tommy and Betty were eventually returned. ,  When you fish, picnic, or drive along the Paint Creek Scenic Byway, ponder the ordeal of Mary and her family. Where you step into the water to lure a fish, Mary may have stumbled across Paint Creek holding little Georgie on her hip. Where you stop to unpack your picnic buffet, Mary�s captors may have offered their charges some blackberries and roasted turtle meat to sustain them for another ten miles. Where you, from the comfort of your car, see the beautiful redbud blooming along the road bank in spring, Mary may have spied the wild comfrey, with which she tended her sister-in-law�s wounded arm. Even with the noise of traffic on the interstate highway never far away, the gurgling of the riffles and waterfalls of Paint Creek can carry your imagination back to Mary�s ordeal. ,  You will find yourself asking the question that all modern readers of Mary�s story ask, &#8220;Could I do what Mary did?&#8221;"},{"id":137757,"title":"Standard, WV","pos":[38.12899,-81.38752],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=137757","desc":"Standard, WV.

The town of Mucklow received its name from one of the early business men and coal operator�s on Paint Creek. In 1900 Richard M.

Richard remained active in the coal business for many years and died in Charleston in 1938 at the age of 77.

The village of Mucklow was a hotbed of activity during the Mine War of 1912-1913. In February of 1913 striking miners waged an attack on an encampment of Baldwin-Felts guards that were stationed there. The guards had lever action Winchesters and a Gatling gun. They would run the Gatling gun until it would get hot and then they would let it up, when the other men would start up with their Winchester rifles. ,  The town of Gallagher was one of several towns on Paint Creek that could boast that it had a theatre for the entertainment of its residents. The first theatre was built and operated in Gallagher in 1916. The theatre closed its doors in 1928. Silent movies was all that was showing, talking movies had not been developed.

The town of Holly Grove first came into prominence during the 1912-1913 coal strike and mine war. This was the location of a major tent colony that was established when the Paint Creek miners were evicted from their homes by the coal companies. Fred Mooney, in his autobiography gave the following description of Holly Grove in 1912: <blockquote>Holly Grove was a small place with nothing but a post office and two or three stores and only four or five dwellings but it immediately spread out and up and down the creek with long rows of tepees and wall tents nestled along the banks of Paint Creek and even up the ravines. The population of Holly Grove immediately sprung into the hundreds consisting of striking miners and their wives and children.</blockquote>  ,  This area was also the scene of much violence during this time period; several were killed on both sides of the conflict. The most notable incident occurred on the night of Feb. 7, 1913 when the town was sprayed with machine gun bullets fired from the armored plated &#8220;Bull Moose Special.&#8221; ,  In 1963 in an issue of the <i>Charleston Gazette-Mail,</i> William G. Blizzard had this to say regarding the &#8220;Bull Moose Special&#8221; <blockquote>This was a special train that had been designed by the C&O railroad to transport strikebreakers into Paint Creek and Cabin Creek. It consisted of an engine that had been fitted with sheet iron to protect the engineer, an ordinary passenger car and a baggage car. The baggage car had thick iron plates on the inside across the doors and was equipped with two machine guns and about 15 high powered rifles; this was the standard arsenal for the Bull Moose. But on the night of Feb. 7th there were 30 additional rifles on the train. Quinn Morton who had started the whole strike with his lockout, had just purchased them from Lowenstein�s, a Charleston hardware store. ,  Morton called the C&O and had their officials send the &#8220;Bull Moose&#8221; to Charleston to pick up Bonner Hill (Sheriff of Kanawha County). In all there were about 16-17 men who rode the Bull Moose that night. ,  The Bull Moose approached the union stronghold of Holly Grove at about 11 pm. It is not unlikely that union miners, warned of the approach of the train fired upon it. In any case the Bull Moose opened fire upon Holly Grove, where women and children as well as armed men were sleeping until awakened by gunfire. In the narrow valley the range from railroad track to town was point blank.</blockquote>"},{"id":137843,"title":"East Bank High School","pos":[38.21626,-81.44198],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=137843","desc":"East Bank High School. .

This is most utilized in mid to late summer when rainfall has diminished and water quality diminishes along the Kanawha River. Releases from upstream reservoirs including Summersville Lake, are made to manipulate dissolved oxygen content and/or temperature in downstream rivers to maintain a healthy river environment for West Virginia fish and wildlife. ,  <b>Hydropower Completed.</b> In 2001 a privately owned hydropower facility was completed below Summersville Dam. The hydropower facility at maximum capacity is able to produce 80 Megawatts of power with a flow of 4,300 cfs (cubic feet per second). In 2015, The Summersville Dam hydropower plant was able to produce 208,000 MWh (MegaWatt hours) of energy. This can provide power for up to 14,989 homes. This is enough energy to provide power for 57% of Charleston's households annually. ,  <b>The Gauley River.</b> The Gauley River located below the dam is among the World�s best whitewater runs. The World Rafting Championship was held here in 2001. In total there are over 100 Rapids in the 25 miles of river. ,  <b>Dam Facts.</b> Max flow : 14,800 cfs (cubic feet per second) . 2nd highest earthen dam in the Eastern U.S. .

After some negotiations, early settler Andrew Jackson Mullins agreed to sell right-of-way through his property, provided a railroad station was built near his store and the Deepwater company engineer lay out a plot for the town. The railroad was completed to Mullens in November of that year, setting the stage for the growth of not only the town, but for the entire Upper Guyandotte River area. The town served as the center of commerce for dozens of nearby coal towns including Itmann, Otsego, Caloric, Mead Poca, and Tralee, as well as the timber industry. Ritter Lumber, which had operations in surrounding states, was located in Maben just north of here. By 1960, the population grew from the original family of 12 to 3,544. ,  In 1907, the Deepwater merged with the Tidewater Railway forming the Virginian Railroad, which had a large presence in Mullens.

With massive amounts of coal now being shipped from the region, the Elmore rail yard was soon built, where most of the coal that traveled along the Virginian ended up before heading to the Virginia coast for shipment. The rugged terrain between the Elmore Yard and Clarks Gap was a challenge for the locomotives as they started their journey to the coast. In order to conquer the steep grade, the world�s largest locomotives were used. In 1925, the Virginian eased the burden by electrifying the rails between Mullens and Roanoke, Virginia. This move brought even more growth to Mullens as all the Virginian electric locomotives were serviced here. ,  In 1959, the Virginian merged with the Norfolk and Western Railway.

The town spread out in every direction, from the Guyandotte River to the south, Slab Fork Creek to the west, Third Street to the north, and the railroad to the east. Mullens became a thriving town as coal became king and the railroad expanded. The town was incorporated in 1912. The first coal mine in Wyoming County opened in 1913 just south of Mullens in Meade Poca (or South Mullens), and the Virginian opened its division terminal one mile southwest of town in Elmore. ,  In the midst of this growth period however, the business section of Mullens suffered three devastating fires in 1917, 1919, and again in 1920.

Weir</b>. </i> ,   Serpentine Drive, so called because of its winding path resembling the movement of a snake, was an elaborately designed approach road to Earl W. Oglebay's estate, Waddington Farm, in the grand manner of the great estates being built by Oglebay and his contemporaries ,  industrialists and entrepreneurs such as Carnegie, Rockefeller and Vanderbilt.,   It was not meant for speed and convenience but rather to provide a pleasant and relaxing ride through a wooded landscape that showcased the beauty of the property. Although it looked like a natural landscape, every curve and planting was meticulously designed by landscape architects J. Wilkinson Elliott and Arthur Westcott Cowell of Pittsburgh, PA. The driveway featured glades, shrubbery and trees, and a stop that included a lookout. The architects' plan called for the driveway to be visually closed in so that the estate could not be seen from the road until reaching th top.,   While most approach roads end with a dramatic view of the great house on an estate, Serpentine Drive opened up to a view of the vegetable garden and the sweeping vista beyond. This may have been because the hillside was too steep in front of the Mansion, but the view from Serpentine Drive also reflected Mr. Oglebay's passion for agriculture and showcased the estate as a working farm.,   While Serpentine Drive was a privately built and maintained road used exclusively by members of the Oglebay family and their guests, others arrived at Waddington Farm the more direct way ,  State Route 88. This public road that is used today was actually moved further away from the Mansion at the request of Earl Oglebay after he purchased the property in 1900.,   <i>[Captions:]</i> ,  <small><b><i>Right: for Serpentine Drive, designed by landscape architects J. Wilkinson Elliott and Arthur Westcott Cowell of Pittsburgh, PA.</b> ,  Elliott was a native of Pittsburgh who designed the landscapes of many private estates throughout the Midwest and east coast, including the home of JR Mellon in Pittsburgh. His partner, Arthur W. Cowell, worked in Pittsburgh in his early career before moving to State College, PA to establish Penn State's Department of Landscape Architecture in 1913.,   <b>Above: Gatehouse at the entrance to Serpentine Drive, circa 1908.</b> ,  This was one of three gatehouses that marked each of the entrance drives to Waddington Farm. Originally, each had a gate that was closed in the evenings to provide security for the estate. The Serpentine gatehouse was an exact match for the gatehouse located on Oglebay's main entrance on Route 88. A third gatehouse is at the entrance to Falls Drive. Although the Serpentine Gatehouse was razed in 2012, the other two gatehouses are still in use today as private residences. The stone pillars and iron gate from the Serpentine gatehouse have been relocated to the Mansion Museum driveway.,   <b>Right: Sarita Oglebay Burton and son Courtney Burton, Jr. travel along one of the horseshoe curves along Seprentine Drive, circa 1915.</b> ,  The stone wall in the lower left of the photo is one of two that were in the original architect's plan for Serpentine; both walls are still standing today.

Whipple. The United Mine Workers of America sought to protect coal miners and began to agitate for better working conditions throughout the nation. But, it was difficult to organize the West Virginia miners� union because of the ultimate control the company wielded. Coal operators did all they could to keep the union out. Hiring the ruthless Baldwin Felts Detective Agency, the company encouraged these hired gunmen to rule with force and brutality. ,  The 1912-13 Cabin Creek-Paint Creek Strike began the first major conflict of the West Virginia Mine Wars. If you look to your right, toward Carlisle, the Paint Creek watershed is just a mile or so down the road. This two-year conflict was fought for wage increases as well as the end of the use of guards, black-listing, and the denial of workers� rights to free speech and assembly. Over two years, bloodshed mounted until Governor Henry Hatfield forced a settlement, giving the miners a wage increase and the right to unionize, but not eliminating the dreaded mine guard system. Although this strike was settled, dissatisfaction continued until the 1921 Miners March and the Battle of Blair Mountain, in Logan County, West Virginia. ,  Labor strikes and agitation continued through the decades, as unions fought to improve conditions for coal miners and their families. ,  <b>The Whipple Company Store.</b>  The Whipple Company Store was as much a fortress as a store. The rounded entrance, designed to simulate the portal of a mine, secretly provided the Baldwin Felts guards a hiding place on the ther side of the entrance. The central plate glass window was a reflective surface, alerting the hidden guards of who was approaching. The building�s original steps were narrow and had no handrail, requiring those who ascended to come up sideways, slowing them down. ,  Inside, the guards had other advantages. The acoustics were manipulated in such a way that all sound was directed from the outer walls to the center of the main building, so that anyone standing in that central spot could hear anything said in the building, Stand inside the square at the center of the building and listen to how well you can hear voices in the large room. ,  <b>Mother Jones.</b> Mother Jones was a passionate and fiery orator. This feisty Irishwoman began her union organizing career at the age of 60. An organizer for the UMWA, Mother Jones paid particular attention to West Virginia, promising that when she died she would tell God about &#8220;medieval West Virginia.&#8221; During the 1912-13 Cabin Creek-Paint Creek strike, the miners asked for her by name and she played an active role in the strike. She was jailed in 1913 and placed under house arrest in Pratt, a town further up Paint Creek. After the Paint Creek-Cabin Creek Strike was resolved, Mother Jones continued to work for coal miners� rights throughout West Virginia and the nation. ,  <b>A History Mystery.</b> The Whipple Company Store is indeed an imposing structure. And it contains some mysterious aspects. There is a secret second floor in the building which has no windows and only five  foot-high ceilings.  It was used to house coffins until the 1930�s. It cannot be seen from the outside of the building. ,  Other items in the building will be sure to pique your curiosity. If you look carefully on the wall of the stairway, there is a gray rectangle. Interestingly, when photographed, an image appears in the picture that is unseen just looking at the wall. Upstairs in the adornment room, there are two pieces of wood set in the floor. Every other piece of wood is one long length, but these two pieces were set in with wooden nails. When removed, a tintype of a little girl who died in the room was found. Why was it there? ,  All of these things and more can be found in a tour of the building. Why were they there? It�s a mystery."},{"id":140365,"title":"Disaster Underground","pos":[37.95844,-81.16578],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=140365","desc":"Disaster Underground. . <b>&#8220;Say a prayer for those who died in darkness so we may enjoy the sunlight.&#8221;</b> <i>, Inscription on the miners� memorial in Whipple erected by the Knights of Columbus.</i> ,  The most dreaded sound in the coal camp was when the mine whistle blew without stopping. The mine whistle blew several times during the day: once early in the morning to awaken the miners, again when the work day began, and another when the shift ended. If the whistle blew any other time, it meant trouble in the mine. Women would drop whatever they were doing and run to the tipple to wait for news of their husbands. ,  Coal mining has always been a dangerous job. Hazards on the job include roof falls, cave-ins, and kettle bottoms; human-made dangers such as accidents with coal cars; and long-term injuries such as black lung. The most dreaded danger was the mine disaster, where multiple lives were lost in major mining accidents. Disaster struck the White Oak Valley on several occasions. On May 1, 1907, 16 men were killed in the Whipple Mine, followed by later disasters at Carlisle in 1915 and Whipple in 1916. ,  In the New River Company mines of Stuart, Parral and Whipple, 124 men lost their lives in a span of 15 months in 1906 and 1907. Three coroner juries convened to investigate the deaths in the three separate mine explosions. Sam Dixon, President of the New River Coal Company and undisputed Republican boss of the county, selected all 15 members of the juries and all 15 were coal company officials. In each case, the company was found not to be at fault. ,  Coal miners refused to return to the mines of Stuart and Parral, claiming the safety hazards had not been addressed. Rather than fix the dangers, Dixon solved the problem by changing the name of the mines to Lochgelly and Summerlee."},{"id":140403,"title":"The White Oak Valley","pos":[37.9585,-81.16583],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=140403","desc":"The White Oak Valley. . Pioneers settled the White Oak Valley in the 1800s. In 1892 the mineral rights were sold and the White Oak Fuel Company and the Whipple Colliery Company sunk five mine shafts at Whipple, Carlisle, Oakwood, Scarbro and Wingrove. Each of the five coal camps operated as distinct towns, with its own company store and a one-room school for whites and another for blacks. By the 1920s, a consolidated school for whites was built near the Whipple Company Store and ten years later a consolidated school for blacks was built in Gentry Town, an area independent of the coal camps. A baseball diamond behind the Whipple Company store served all five coal camps. ,  <b>Diversity in the Coal Fields.</b> West Virginia in the late 1800s was sparsely populated and coal mines needed workers. To meet this need, companies attracted African-American coal miners from the South and workers from all over the world. The 1920 census of the five towns in the White Oak Valley shows a significant number of African-Americans and immigrants from the following countries: Poland . Lithuania .  England . \tRussia .  Austria . \tHungary .  Bohemia . \tSlovakia .  Germany . Scotland .  Spain . \tIreland .  Canada . \tMexico .  Syria . \tWales. ,  <b>Polish Immigrants.</b> The largest group of foreign-born immigrants in Whipple were from Poland, and they lived on what is known as Hunk Hill, adjacent to the Catholic Church. Between 1870-1914, more than 2.6 million people left Poland to pursue new economic opportunities in the U.S. and to escape political struggles and religious persecution in their homeland. ,  <b>A History Mystery.</b> The 1910 census shows a large number of Welsh and Italian residents. But, by 1920, there were only one Welsh and 13 Italians. Scholars believe that the Welsh left West Virginia in the 1910s because the union was stronger in other parts of the country. But, why did the Italians leave the White Oak Valley? It is possible with the influx of Polish immigrants, the Catholic Church began to give Mass in Polish and the Italians may have wanted to go to a place where there were more Italians, such as nearby Kilsyth. Who knows why the Italians left in large numbers?

The first coal operators created company towns, or coal camps, where everything was controlled by the company. Miners paid rent for a company house, bought goods at the company store, were treated by the company doctor and went to a church whose preacher was hired by the company. Some of these early captains of industry were patriarchal, treating the miners well. Others ruled with an iron fist. �King� Samuel Dixon was one of these. ,  Dixon was one of the most well-known and controversial of the early coal barons. Born in Scarborough, England, he opened coal mines in West Virginia in 1893, including Scarbro (named for his birthplace), Carlisle, Oakwood and Wingrove. In 1906, Dixon bought Whipple and several other mines and formed the New River Company, dominating the New River coal field. ,  The same year that Sam Dixon started mining, Justus Collins opened the mine at Whipple, along with several other mines. He built identical octagonal company stores in all of his coal camps. The building standing behind you is the only one left. Collins is famous for saying that mine managers should strive for a �judicious mixture� of race and nationality groups, believing it would stop unionization. ,  Sam Dixon and Justus Collins despised each other. Their feud is legendary, even coming to physical altercation. In 1906, Collins sold the Whipple mine to Dixon and left the area. ,  <b>Bramwell.</b> Many of the coal barons in Southern West Virginia gravitated to Bramwell, a small town in Southern West Virginia near Bluefield. Bramwell was once considered the richest town in the U.S., with more millionaires per capita than any other town in the nation. The town prospered with Victorian mansions and a lavish social life. Today, Bramwell is on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic train depot is a Visitor Center and Museum, operated by the Coal Heritage Highway Authority.

Whipple. Coal companies often paid miners in scrip, a form of private money, each coal company issuing their own scrip. So that it would not be confused with American currency, most of the coins had some sort of hole in the middle. Company allowed miners to &#8220;cut&#8221; or &#8220;draw&#8221; scrip against completed work. Often, come payday, a miner would be &#8220;scrip bound,&#8221; meaning he owned his entire paycheck to the company and had to start again in debt. Local businesses independent of the coal company did take scrip, but usually at less than face value. ,  In many coal camps, there were cash prizes for the best flower gardens, but vegetable gardens were illegal. Why? Vegetable gardens fed families during strikes, something mining companies wanted to avoid at all costs. Many miners wives planted beautiful flower gardens by the house but also secretly planted vegetables in the nearby woods. ,  Church was an important part of the social fabric of a coal camp. There was a Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist and Catholic Church, each one identified on its own hill, Methodist Church Hill, Prestbyterian Church Hill and so on. Coal miners worked Monday through Saturday and were expected to be in church on Sunday. ,  The baseball diamond for the towns in the valley was in Whipple, but the Rialto Opera House and Movie Theatre, which served the valley, was in Scarbro. In fact, the town of Scarbro outgrew other camps. Until 1930 it was an incorporated town with a jail, city hall, town marshal, brick yard, Chinese laundry and bottling company.,  <b>Coalfield baseball</b> was very popular. Every coal camp had its own baseball team and competition was fierce. Miners who could play baseball were recruited and given work assignments above ground. There was a ballgame every Sunday in season and large crowds would gather to cheer for the home team. Some players even made it to the major leagues. Behind the Whipple Company Store was Ballpark Hill, the one ballpark for all five coal camps. Major league teams often played exhibition games in Southern West Virginia after their season was complete. In fact, the Cincinnati Reds played Scarbro on October 10, 1908. ,  <b>&#8220;Not a day went by that you weren�t in the company store.&#8221;</b> , <i>Jane Nicholls Burke, daughter of Superintendent of Oakwood and Whipple.</i> , The <b>company store</b> was the hub of the coal camp.

West Virginia 9.  , <b>Shepherdstown and Smithfield Turnpike Tollhouse/John Fox House</b> ,  Immediately west of Rellim Farm is a mid-19th century log dwelling, and the only known surviving toll house on the old Shepherdstown and Smithfield Turnpike (previously Leetown Pike). The turnpike was completed by 1826, being the first toll road of its kind in the \"valley\" region of Virginia. This tollhouse was constructed around 1864. An artist's earlier rendering of a nearby tollhouse on Charles Town Pike shows athat a standard plan for toll houses may have been used by area turnpike companies of the period. The tollhouse is also important as the last remaining structure associated with John Fox, a prosperous African-American who purchased the property in 1869. He became a respected member of both the African-American and Euro-American communities and amassed a large estate during the post-Civil War years. Fox never resided. In the log house, but maintained it as a rental property throughout his life.,   <b>Kearneysville Action Area</b> ,  On August 25, 1864, a major military skirmish occurred about half a mile southwest of Kearneysville between General Jubal Early's Confederate forces and General Phil Sheridan's Federal forces. Both stationed their artillery on high points on opposite sides of Bower Road. After six hours of engagement, Federal forces retreated northward, and Confederates pursued them to the Potomac River resulting in a 5-mile long running battle between Bower Road and the B&O Railroad at Kearneysville to Shepherdstown. No casualty records from the battle exist except from several generals' reports, citing \"considerable losses on both sides.\" It was one of many skirmishes and battles acted out in Jefferson County during the Civil War, as the nearby arsenal at Harpers Ferry and its proximity to Washington D.C. contributed to the county's strategic military importance. The Kearneysville Action represented a turning point in the Confederate push to re-enter Maryland and Pennsylvania during the latter portion of the Shenandoah Valley Campaign.,   <b>Rellim Farm/Abraham S. Miller House</b> ,  Rellim Farm was established by Abraham S. Miller, who married Thomas Turner's daughter, Mary Susan, and in 1880 purchased a part of Turner's Rockdale Farm. That year, the Millers began operating a cattle farm, which Abraham named \"Rellim\" farm by reversing the spelling of \"Miller\". In 1888, he constructed the large, extant Colonial Revival-style house. By the turn of the 20th century, Rellim Farm had become an important orchard farm producing apples, pears, and quince. In the 1920s, Rellim Farm also began producing sour cherries, becoming one of the earliest cherry orchards still operating in the region, with its historic botanical stock maintained. The property is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a significant early commercial orchard and rural historic landscape.,   <b>Sunnyside Farm</b> ,  Sunnyside Farm is listed in the National Register of Historic Places for its association with the agricultural development of Jefferson County and for contributions to the regional dairy industry by its owner William Fulk (shown in the right in a circa 1914 photograph). Fulk purchased the far land in 1891 and in 1914 built the extant 2&#189;-story, brick dwelling, which is also significant for its Colonial Revival architecture. William Fulk was instrumental in the local dairy industry, helping to establish the Kearneysville Creamery in 1913. The Creamery produced its own ice, and the milk was condensed at the plant and sold to ice cream factories in Cumberland and Hagerstown, Maryland. After a boiler system was added for pasteurization, fresh milk, cream, and butter also were produced there, as were several kinds of cheese."},{"id":148882,"title":"Peter Burr / William Burr Houses","pos":[39.35833,-77.86089],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=148882","desc":"Peter Burr, also, William Burr Houses. West Virginia 9.  ,  On the east side of WV 9 is one of the oldest standing frame (post and beam) buildings in West Virginia. It was constructed in three sections, with the oldest, 1�-story eastern section dating between 1751 and 1755. The voids between the studs that frame the house were infilled with brick and mortar, then plastered, and covered with clapboards. Elements on the earliest portion of the building, such as the steeply pitched (medieval form) saltbox roof, small windows, and tall massive chimney, reflect New England building traditions brought to Virginia with its builder, Peter Burr I, who arrived from Connecticut around 1748.,   After constructing the home, Peter Burr I returned to New England, where he died in 1777. His son, Peter Burr II, resided there instead, raising a family of 13 children by two successive wives. Though of prominent background, with family ties to the first president of Princeton University and the third vice president of the United States, Beter Burr held no public office, but remained a yeoman farmer throughout his life. To accommodate a growing family throughout his life. To accommodate a growing family, he added the (western) log addition to the house in the 1760s. It was not until circa 1804, under different ownership, that the log and earlier frame sections were connected by a beam and board middle addition. Following Peter Burr's death in 1793, the house was inherited by his son, Peter III, who sold it out of the family before emigrating to Ohio in 1798. The 1886 purchase by John McGarry, a descendent of Peter Burr, brought the house back under Burr family control.,   The Peter Burr house is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as the home of a prominent early settler in the region and as a rare surviving example of early settlement-period post and beam architecture. In 1976, the house was designated a Jefferson County Historic Landmark, for being one of the oldest extant structures in the State of West Virginia. The Landmarks Commission acquired the house and began restoration efforts in 1998.,   Opposite the Peter Burr House, on the west side of WV 9, is the William Burr House, located on the property that Peter Burr II bequeathed to his son, William, in 1793. The house was constructed in 1809 in the Greek Revival style. Later it was owned by West Virginia State Senator Milton Burr, from 1919 to 1922. Burr was important to the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution concerning women's suffrage."},{"id":148883,"title":"Gap View Farm","pos":[39.34319,-77.85539],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=148883","desc":"Gap View Farm.

In 1774, the grant passed to Walter Baker, who is credited with building the original portion of the main dwelling. The large Georgian, vernacular, and Colonial Revival-style house began as a single-pen, side-hall house and was enlarged through several later building phrases under different owners. Among them were James L. Ranson, who served as a second lieutenant in the War of 18 12, and later the Charles Aglionby family, who occupied and/or rented the land between 1871 and 1928. A ca. 1935 photograph shows several building features that have since been removed, including a 2-story frame addition, stucco covering over the masonry section, stepped gables, and 2-story Victorian front porch.,   With the farm in continuous operation since the mid-eighteenth century, numerous support structures were built to meet the demands of an expanding agricultural enterprise. The present 330-acre farm includes 29 buildings and structures, including an 18th-century log tenant house, and 1860 smoke house, a 1937 tenant house, and at least 14 agricultural support structures from the early to mid 20th century. The property also featured a cluster of slave quarters at the northeast corner, referred to as \"Tiger Row\", were absorbed into the town of Shenandoah Junction as an African-American enclave.,   Gap View Farm is listed in the National Register of Historic Places for its association with regional exploration and settlement, being one of the earliest documented farmsteads in Jefferson County.

Transforming a Contaminated Industrial Site to a Community Park and Nature Area.  ,  This 5.26-acre waterside community park was created through a collaborative effort by the City of Charles Town, the Evitts Run Conservancy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the West Virginia Department of Environmental PRotection. This park is part of a broader vision for transformation of the Evitts Run Creek corridor into a system of parks, nature and recreational areas that includes Evitts Run Park, the Jefferson County Boys and Girls Club, and the Ranson Civic Center to the north; Charles Washington Park and Happy Retreat to the southeast; and other community green spaces and parks planned for the future along Evitts Run Creek. This property was given to the community by the Perry Family, who donated much of the land that makes up the Evitts RUn Park system as part of their contributions to the Charles Town community for generations.,   This creekside park area in front of you was historically the location of a Manufactured Gas Plant. During the 1800s, in towns and cities across the United States manufactured gas was produced from materials such as coal, diesel and other fuels. The fuel produced at a manufactured gas plant (MGP) was used to light homes, businesses and street lamps. Prior to World War II, over a thousand such plants existed throughout the United States, particularly in cities and towns in the East and Midwest. When the interstate pipeline introduced natural gas in the 1950's, MGPs rapidly disappeared. However, the operations of these plants left MGP by-products (tar and oils) at these sites that are being cleaned up under today's environmental standards.,   The City of Charles Town and the and the Evitts Run Conservancy used more than $1 million in resources from the U.S. EPA and local contributors to cap the impacted area of the site with a geo-synthetic membrane that separates the MGP by-product impacted soils from clean soils placed above the membrane. The membrane ensures that the MGP-impacted soils remain in place and are not moved by surface water runoff, erosion, or other means into Evitts Run Creek, making the site protective of public health and the environment, while providing a much needed amenity on the West End of Charles Town.,   One of the unique features incorporated into this park is a raingarden. Raingardens, also referred to as bio-retention filters are a type of green infrastructure that handles and cleans stormwater runoff while also adding both beauty and functionality to the raingarden through both underground and aboveground engineered systems. This raingarden incorporates many of the pollutant removal mechanism that operate in a forested ecosystem. During the storms the stormwater runoff will pond above the mulch and soil in the system, and then filter through the much and prepared soil mix filtering any remaining pollution, supply clean groundwater to the underlying aquifer, help maintain stream flows during summer dry months, and provide habitat for butterflies, birds and other woodland creatures.,   When not handling stormwater, this raingarden could provide amenity space for the community to gather at the benches under the surrounding shade trees, a rest stop while walking the many planned trails, and could double as a stormwater control educational facility in addition to serving stormwater treatment functions.,   With cleanup complete, this long-time polluted site has become a park that will support healthy lifestyles, access to nature, and family enjoyment for the future."},{"id":148889,"title":"Thornton Tayloe Perry / Thornton Tayloe Perry II","pos":[39.22061,-77.81638],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=148889","desc":"Thornton Tayloe Perry, also, Thornton Tayloe Perry II. . <center> In memory of  <b>Thornton Tayloe Perry (1863 - 1954)</b> who acquired a major portion of Shannondale Springs  and his nephew  <b>Thornton Tayloe Perry; II (1892 - 1981)</b>  who had the vision to preserve Shannondale Springs  in its natural state.

Both Michael Blue and his brother Uriah had served with Richard Blackburn as foot soldiers in Delaware in 1757 and through him learned of the farming opportunities in Jefferson (then Berkeley) County. So successful were the brothers that Michael Blue purchased the 150 acres of Tackley Farm in 1795.

West Virginia 9.  ,  The Shaw Run Wetland Complex is a calcareous fen. A \"fen\" is defined as low land covered wholly or partly with water. fed by Shaw Spring and Shaw Run, the wetland is a unique type of wetland for West Virginia because of its marl substratum (layer beneath the surface soil layer) which contains substantial amounts of calcium carbonate. This causes the spring water to become extremely alkaline. These alkaline waters provide ideal conditions for many species of plants and animals, which would not normally be found in this part of West Virginia.,   Field studies conducted in July 2000 noted that the Shaw Run Wetland Complex is a broad riparian wetland, roughly 300 feet wide. It has two sources of water (hydrologic sources). Shaw Run is a narrow spring fed perennial stream that originates near Traveller's Rest and flows north to Opequon Creek. In places, the stream bed consists of exposed limestone. The second source of water for the wetland complex is the Shaw Spring, located to the west of WV Route 9, east of the Quail Ridge subdivision, and southwest of the Liberty Business Park. Plant species common to the wetland include <i>Impatiens capensis</i> (Jewel Weed), <i>Veriona noveboracensis</i> (New York Ironweed), <i>Mimulus rigens</i> (Alleghany Monkey Flower), <i>Mentha spicata</i> (Spearmint), <i>Acomus calamus</i> (Sweet Flag), <i>Salidago sp.</i> (Goldenrod), and <i>Carex sp.</i> (Sledge).,   The Shaw Run Wetland Complex is protected under the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986. Through this federal legislation, the WVDOH purchased 4.5 acres of this sensitive stream/wetland complex and an adjacent 6.5 acres of upland area to serve as a buffer to protect it from possible future development. This property has been deeded to the WV Department of Natural Resources (WVDNR) for conservation/preservation purposes and to meet mitigation requirements of the WV Route 9 Charles Town to Martinsburg project.,   Wetlands are scarce resources in West Virginia, in part because of the mountainous topography which does not lend itself readily to wetland formation. Wetlands are also scarce because wet areas were filled for land development and farming, a practice common across the United States until the enactment of the Clean Water Act in 1977. According to Roger Anderson of the WVDNR, wetlands now cover somewhere between 57,000 and 102,000 acres across the state, less than 1 percent of the total land area in West Virginia. This is roughly 24 percent than the 134,000 acres that covered West Virginia in the 1700s.,   <b><i>What is a wetland?</i></b> Wetlands are areas having three characteristics: vegetation that grows best in wet conditions; specific soil types that form under continuous or frequent soaking with water; and water being present for part or all of the growing season. Wetlands can range in size from a small wet spot to large expanses such as the Canaan Valley Wetland Complex, which at roughly 10,000 acres in size, is the largest wetland area in the state.,   <b><i>Why are wetlands so valuable?</b></i> Wetlands provide a number of benefits: ,   . Reduce flooding by holding and absorbing floodwaters ,   . Filter silt and debris and neutralize pollutants in water that drains in to wetland ,   . Provide fish and wildlife habitat, particularly breeding and spawning areas ,   . Provide shelter and food for many rare, threatened and endangered species found in the state ,   . Recharge increasingly important groundwater reserves ,   .

The property is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark as the home of General Horatio Gates (1727-1806), a major military figure in the Revolutionary War from 1773 to 1790. Born in England, Gates became a professional soldier in the British Army and fought in North America during the French and Indian War.,   In 1773, Gates purchased 659 acres in present-day Jefferson County, upon which he built his still extant 1&#189;-story, limestone house. Based on a mid 18th-century survey map and architectural plans drawn up for Gates's \"new\" residence, the eastern half of the house was most likely built for previous owner John Hyatt sometime prior to 1753. Gates then added the western wing and renovated the interior of the older eastern section in 1773. The work was performed under the direction of Virginia architect John Ariss, who is credited with designing the Neo-Palladian villa Mount Airy, a National Historic Landmark property in Richmond County, Virginia.,   At the onset of the Revolutionary War, Horatio Gates joined the American cause, being appointed in Congress in 1775 to the position of Adjutant General of the Continental Army. In that post, he drafted the first set of army regulations. After his promotion to commander of the army's northern department in 1777, General Gates successfully led many campaigns, including capturing nearly 6,000 men at Saratoga in 1777, the first great American victory of the war. The feat earned him a Congressional Gold Medal and a public day of thanksgiving. In 1780, after his disastrous defeat at the Battle of Camden (South Carolina), Gates lost his command but was returned to active service in 1782, and was stationed in New York for the remainder of the war. In 1790, Gates sold Traveller's Rest, moved to New York, the seat of the new federal government, and remained there for the duration of his life.,   <b>Aspendale/West Virginia University Experimental Farm</b> ,  In 1868, the northern portion of Horatio Gates's Traveller's REst property was sold to brothers Daniel and Edward Getzendanner. Several years later Daniel Getzendanner, a general farmer and stock raiser, built the current 2-story brick farmhouse, calling the property Aspendale. Blending both Georgian and Greek Revival elements, the house represents an uncommon example of a local adaptation of national stylistic influences.,   In 1930, the West Virginia State Board of Control purchased 158 acres of the prime agricultural land from the Aspendale Farm, including the house and outbuildings, for use as an experimental farm by West Virginia University (WVU). Since then, Aspendale has continued to function in this capacity, with the farmhouse serving as the residence of the farm manager. Several stone outbuildings surrounding the main dwelling were constructed in the 1940s and 1950s by the Jones family, locally prominent stone masons.,   The experimental farm provided the University with a research and educational facility for developing pesticides and disease control methods relative to the orchard industry, which has been an important aspect of the Eastern Panhandle economy since the 19th-century. New cultural varieties have been developed at the WVU Experimental Farm including an improved York-type apple."},{"id":150636,"title":"Veterans Memorial","pos":[39.34122,-78.75457],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=150636","desc":"Veterans Memorial. . <center> Dedicated to  All Veterans,   All gave some  Some gave all.

Each Foundation improvement brings us closer to fulfilling Ken's dream.,   In the early 1990s, recognizing the threat to the place where \"an old fort\" had stood, Ken was instrumental in founding and leading a grass-roots coalition, opposing a planned development on the site of a French and Indian War fort. He fought to preserve the location as having historical merits and significance. The coalition became The Fort Edwards Foundation, Inc., in 1995. Ken's leadership at the outset began a long, fruitful association with the Foundation.,   The Foundation envisions this trail as an on-going project, eventually extending east to the bank of the Cacapon River, north along the river, curving back past an overlook at the site of the original fort, and returning a determined walker to the Visitor Center near the Kitchen Garden. This rebuilt bridge and the hard-packed composition of the trail was designed to accommodate our friends with disabilities who wish to use the trail.,   Enjoy your walk, whether to the stockade or beyond.

George Washington's Chain of Forts Guarding the Eighteenth Century Virginia Froniter","pos":[39.30343,-78.43384],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=150674","desc":"Forts in Col. George Washington's Chain of Forts Guarding the Eighteenth Century Virginia Froniter. .  ,  <b>War Comes to the Frontier</b>,   It took over one hundred years from the time that European settlers first began to build Jamestown until Governor Spotswood and his Knights of the Golden Horseshoe stood on the Blue Ridge Mountains and gazed across the Shenandoah Valley to the mountains to the west. The mountains seemed a formidable barrier, but they were also a land of hope and plenty for the Scotch-Irish and Germans who were invited to build settlements as a barrier to French encroachment from the west.,   Within ten to fifteen years settlers began to come to this frontier and discover its bounty. The news of this land of plenty then brought more settlers streaming into the headwaters of the Potomac and James Rivers, two great avenues from the east. Unfortunately, it then took only about twenty five years before war came to these peaceful valleys and majestic mountains.,   In 1749, the year that George Washington began his surveying business along the headwaters of the Potomac River, the French explorer Celeron came down the Ohio River claiming all the area it drained for the King of France. Virginia would reply to this encroachment upon land it claimed by sending George Washington to meet the French and demand their removal. The British had long hoped that their settlers would soon move west out of the mountains into the far more fertile Ohio River valley and begin settling the heartland of the continent.,   When the French refused to give up their claims, the stage was set for war. It would be the young Washington who would become commander of the Virginia forces and have the responsibility of guarding this vast frontier. It would be the settlers hoping to begin a new life of opportunity in this land who would suffer most.,   For Col. Washington the task was daunting. Where once the settlers saw bountiful valleys separated by rugged mountains offering seclusion and independence, the Commander of the Virginia Regiment saw a nightmare of supply and administration. With few resources, including men to fill his ranks, Washington decided to build a chain of forts about a day's ride apart to guard the frontier. From these bastions his men could range the frontier searching for the enemy, yet have a safe haven at night or when they were outnumbered.,   Along with these forts built and manned by Washington's Virginia Regiment, there were county militia forts and also fortified homes of settlers. Washington would take over some of these other forts and include them in his chain of forts running from the Potomac River to the North Carolina border. The fort at Joseph Edwards's land on the Cacapon River was one of these forts.,   <b>Fort Edwards</b>,   It is not known exactly when or by whom the parts of the fort at Joseph Edwards's plantations were built, but it became an important link in Col. Washington's chain of forts. It was the first fort west of Washington's headquarters at Fort Loudoun in Winchester. It was a day's march from that fort and a day's march from Fort Pearsal at what is now Romney. At this point one can follow the Great Wagon Road to the South Branch and on to Fort Cumberland, or one can turn south and travel to Fort Pleasant below the Trough and on to the southern forts.,   On April 18, 1756 the largest battle of the Virginia frontier was fought near here. The newspapers reported, \"A Party of Indians appearing in the Neighbourhood of the Fort, Capt. Mercer went out with three Subalterns, and 60 pick'd Men, and about a Mile from the Fort was attacked by a superior Number of Indians, whom they fought for some Time with good Success, but (the Enemy being reinforced by another Party) were at length obliged to give Way and retire to the Fort; Captain John Mercer, and Lieutenant Thomas Carter, two brave Virginian Youths, Volunteers in the Defense of their Country, were, with 15 men left in the Field; they died bravely the most honourable of Deaths�\",   This site of Fort Edwards is the only one of the settler's forts in the entire chain that has been definitely located and examined by archaeologists and is now interpreted for the public.,   <b>Fort Pleasant</b>,   Originally called Waggener's lower Fort because it was one of two forts south of the Trough that were built by Capt. Thomas Waggener, Fort Pleasant became one of the most important forts in Washington's chain of forts. This fort was one of the few that was built solely by the Virginia Regiment to Col. Washington's specifications rather than being one adapted from a settler's home site. It was built adjacent to the most productive area of Hampshire County and served as an important incentive to the settlers to stay on their farms and supply produce for the military. It served as a collection point for supplies going to Fort Pitt at the end of the war. For a number of years it also served as the location of the Hampshire County Court until the Court finally moved to Romney.,   <b>Fort Ashby</b>,   Fort Ashby was another fort built solely by the REgiment to Washington's plan. Archaeological investigation has not been able to determine its outline, but Washington's instructions called for a quadrangle fort ninety feet on a side with corner bastions and barracks and a magazine. We know from records that Daniel Morgan, later a general in the Revolutionary War, served at this fort on Patterson's Creek. While traveling from Ashby's to Edwards's, Morgan was ambushed by Indian and severely wounded. He bore the scar from a bullet through his neck and cheek for the rest of his life.,   Today, Fort Ashby is owned by the DAR and is open periodically for tours and for special events. For information go to: www.AshbysFort.com,   <b>Pearsal's Fort <small>[also spelled Pearsall]</small></b>,   Job Pearsal was an early settler on the South Branch River. Exactly when he came is not certain, but his name appears on the Fry and Jefferson Map of 1754 located on the east bank of the river astride the road from Winchester. Col. Washington first refers to the fort at this site in October, 1755. In his Council of War on July 10, 1756, Col. Washington stresses that, \"it will be found necessary to maintain a Block-house at Pearsalls, to secure that difficult pass, and keep the communication open.\",   Pearsal's was used as a supply base for the forts of the South Branch and for supplies to go to Virginia troops at Ft. Cumberland. Troops at this fort were used to protect the neighborhood as well as to escort messengers and convoys. Both Virginia Regiment and Militia troops were stationed at various times, and friendly Indians were in attendance on numerous occasions.,   <b>Settler's Forts of Hampshire County</b>,   Aside from the already-mentioned forts, there were other forts in Hampshire County. However, there are few records of their constructions or activities other than the early anecdotal histories of the area. Therefore, we do not know for sure how they were constructed and whether they were stockaded or walled. They may have been only fortified houses.,   THomas Parker lived on the North River across from the present village of North River Mills. His location is marked on the Fry and Jefferson map on the important Great Wagon Road from Winchester to the South Branch. Col. Washington sent soldiers to guard him and his neighbors one harvest time. Aside from that we know very little about this small settler's fort.,   Among other forts were several in the South Branch River valley. One of these was William's fort. It was located in the bend of the river at Hanging Rock. It is known because of a story in Kercheval's History of the Valley of Virginia where someone found refuge at William's fort. It is stories like these that are often the only way we know of forts.,   Henry Enoch lived at the Forks of Capon where the North River joins the Cacapon River. Gen. Edward Braddock had camped at this point in his march through the county. After Braddock's defeat Enoch, like other settlers, fortified his location and it became an important fort in the county, because it afforded protection on the new road that Braddock had built from Winchester to Fort Cumberland. It also was part of Col. Washington's chain of forts.,   <b>Southern Virginia</b>,   Since Col. Washington spent most of his time as a surveyor in Hampshire County and as a soldier in the vicinity of forts Loudoun, Pleasant and Cumberland, one often forgets that southern Virginia was also well settled by the beginning of the French and Indian War. The James River was a navigable route to the backcountry, and settlers had moved into its headquarters as quickly as they had into the Potomac's. Just as Hampshire County had a route for French allied Indians so travel from Fort Duquesne along Braddock's Road, so the enemy had a route east from Ohio and Kentucky along the New River.,   The map below shows the main forts of the James River and Roanoke River areas. These were just as important as the ones further north and saw just as much action during the war and just as much suffering on the part of the settlers."},{"id":151996,"title":"Robert Foyles & Family","pos":[38.84085,-79.87517],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=151996","desc":"Robert Foyles and Family. . <center><b>This Stone Commemorates:</b> <b>Robert Foyles and Family</b>, killed by Indians 1753, half mi.

Only the support of the <small>JCS</small> saved Truman from impeachment.,   Ridgway took Macarthur's command and held off the Communists with strong fortifications and entrenchments just North of the 38th Parallel. Peace negotiations dragged on.

Jubal A. Early's raid on Washington, D.C., and had burned Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, in retaliation of Federal \"depredations\" in the Shenandoah Valley, which had likewise been in retaliation for Confederate \"atrocities.\" Union Gen. William W. Averell, whose command was in pursuit, surprised the Confederate pickets north of here by attacking with \"Jesse Scouts\" (Federal soldiers in Confederate uniforms). He drove Johnson's men through here toward Parson's Ford. Averell captured four cannons, more than 400 men with their weapons, and, about as bad for the Confederates at this stage of the war, an equal number of hard to replace horses. Early claimed that \"this affair had a very damaging effect upon my cavalry for the rest of the campaign\" in terms of both morale and horses.

Jonah Edward Kelley.  ,  This Memorial is to pay tribute to Keyser's Medal of Honor recipient <i>Jonah Edward Kelley.</i> Born and raised in this area, Ed Kelley represented the best of West Virginia, character, values, hard work and sheer determination to do what's right, regardless of the obstacles. Ed Kelley walked these grounds, played on the ball fields around Keyser, and graduated from the school directly in front of you, Keyser High School, in 1941.,   In 1998, a new Keyser High School opened south of town, leaving this building vacant. The following year, the School was purchased and renovated by Grand Central Business Center. Governor Underwood was the Key Speaker at the grand opening of the new business center, and from that event sprang the dedication to place a permanent memorial in honor of Ed Kelley on grounds of the school where Ed Kelley spent his formative years.,   Eugene Newhouse, a KHS graduate and employee of Grand Central Business Center, spoke at the grand opening and articulated a vision for a permanent memorial. While he had heard many people around town speak of a memorial for years, Eugene challenged the community to embark on building a memorial now, while members of the 78th Division who had fought with Ed Kelley were still alive and able to enjoy it. In attendance that day was Boy Scout Steven Warner, visiting from Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania (home of the US Army War College). Steven heard Eugene's challenge, and decided to help make the Memorial a reality by taking on the challenge as part of his Eagle Scout project.,   Steven began to work closely with Done Heare of Keyser's American Legion Post 41. Under Don Heare's guidance, various memorial proposals were identified, ideas for fundraising were considered and historical research was initiated. Steven was instrumental in raising over $8,000 for the Memorial, and designing a prototype of the Memorial before you today. Most importantly, Steven spent numerous hours researching the historical accuracy of Ed Kelley's exploits, especially as to what spurred General Eisenhower to make the statement, \"Single-handedly, Ed Kelley shortened the War in Europe by two months.\",   The answer to that question is put forth for your review in the accompanying placards. We invite you to take the time to read Ed Kelley's historic story. He was a significant actor in the most monumental event of the 20th Century ,  the defeat of Nazism and the ascendancy of the United States of America and our ideals of freedom and democracy to prominence in world history. The successful completion of world war two marked the first true hope for the equality of man as espoused by Jesus Christ some 2000 years ago to become a reality for the majority of the world's population. While the world struggled for another 45 years to defeat Communism, it too, was destined for \"the dustbin of history\", again, due to gallant stands by individuals of character like Ed Kelley. Today, the world stands shoulder to shoulder, embraced to withstand the onslaught of Islamic terrorists. Who knows what \"ism\" or fanatic tomorrow will present, but be assured someone will rise to test American resolve. We should learn from Ed Kelley, emulate his strengths, and be ready to commit just as members of the gallant 78th Division did when duty called.

Germany's Roer River was the last major natural obstacle before striking the main objective ,  the Ruhr Valley. Yet, it was too dangerous for American troops to cross the Roer until they destroyed or controlled the Schwammenauel Dam ,  it controlled water flow between them and their objective. From Generals Eisenhower and Bradley to company commanders and sergeants, US Forces knew that to proceed without control would risk thousands of lives and key supply line should the Germans decide to blow the dam or release flood waters. Simply put, the dam was essential top US success in reaching our number one objective.,   Air raids in early December 1944 proved unsuccessful, thereby making a ground assault on that dam through the Monshau Corridor necessary. On the key high ground of the Monshau Corridor ,  ground from which the entire region could be observed and fired upon ,  was the town of Kesternich.

As American Forces tried valiantly to take Kesternich, they met head on with elements of four German Divisions marching in to the Ardennes Forest, in what was to become known as \"The Bulge\".,   Not only had the Germans \"sowed mines like grain\" around Kesternich, but fresh snow completely hid the mines from view. The snow also worked to the German defenders' advantage by silhouetting anything that moved. To make the assault more difficult, Kesternich stuck out \"like a big neck\" into enemy lines, making it open to German artillery fire from three sides. As bad as the initial scenario appeared, things could and would get worse.,   The 78th opened its assault on Kesternich on December 13th. The entire town shook as German artillery pounded the 78th from three sides. Fighting through mine fields, barbed wire, and machine gun fire, the 78th would inch forward, but them be repelled. All day the battle raged, but the German line held. As darkness closed on the 13th, US soldiers took a few houses at the edge of town, but had to withdraw before nightfall.,   On the 14th, the weather stayed bad, and the situation grew grim as US casualties mounted. At one point, the 10th Panzer Division captured a US Battalion Commander and most of his men. Another Battalion Commander and his Executive Officer were killed in Kesternich. Later, a US Captain and 56 of his men were captured and \"disappeared into Germany.\" The Germans used everything they had ,  artillery, mortars, machine guns, snipers, mines and booby traps ,  to stop the advancing Americans. The men in Kesternich on December 14th were in \"one of the toughest spots of the war.\",   The 78th called for \"all supporting artillery\" and eight US battalions responded.

He chose the Ardennes Forest, knowing US Forces would not expect an attack there. With strict secrecy, he massed his forces south of Monshau. He planned airborne drops, a massive armored assault, and Special Forces attacks by SS troops using American uniforms and equipment to get through US lines. He then waited for bad weather to provide cover from Allied air attacks. The snow that plagued US Forces in the Monshau Corridor was the catalyst for the German assault.,   On December 16th the great German counter offensive ,  Hitler's last bid for victory ,  began. Designed to cut through to Antwerp, the Germans made a significant salient into Allied lines. Confusion gripped the Allies, as Bradley thought it a spoiling attack to forestall Patton's drive to the South. Eisenhower however, saw it for what it was, and began moving Armored Divisions to stop it. The German airdrop was not effective militarily, but it sent psychological shock waves across the Allied front. Extra security measures were taken as far west as Paris.,   Recognizing the enormous threat, on December 17th, Eisenhower committed his theater reserve, the 101st Airborne Division, to hold vital road centers. The 101st was sent to Bastogne, where it was quickly surrounded by the German salient. In one of the most dramatic moments of the War, the German Commander asked the 101st Division Commander, Brig. Gen. A. C. McAuliffe, to surrender. McAuliffe, exemplifying the American fighting spirit, answered with a one word response: \"<small>NUTS!</small>\",   On December 18th Bradley ordered Patton to suspend the Saar offensive and move north to help stop the \"Bulge\" and to relieve the 101st. Patton moved into position, and began his drive to relieve Bastogne on December 22nd. Having intercepted US radio messages, the Germans were ready for the assault and Patton made little progress. The weather began to clear on December 23rd (following Patton's famous request of his Chaplain for prayer for good weather) allowing for aerial resupply of Bastogne. Meanwhile, German advances had slowed due to lack of fuel, and traffic jams.

Hardened to winter warfare on the Russian front, the Germans waged a fighting retreat ,  taking Allied casualties for every foot of ground. Allies ought the entire month of January 1945 to restore the front to where it had been on December 16th, 1944. From January 3, 1945 to March 28, 1945 the US suffered another 39,672 casualties.

Both sides incurred heavy casualties, but the American objective to pave the way to Schmidt and the Schwammenauel Dam was complete. For action under the most extreme circumstances and opposition, two Battalions in the 311th were awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation.,   With the capture of Kesternich, the momentum of the 78th Division began to build. Within days, the towns of Dedenborn and Ruhrberg were captured, clearing the way for Schmidt, the guardian town of the Schwammenauel Dam. The urgency of the capture of the Dam cannot be overstated as all Allied operations downstream on the Roer were at a standstill until the Dam was under US control. By unleashing the 22 billions of gallons of water the massive dam held, the Germans could have sent an 18 foot high wall of water down the valley, washing away any major crossing of the river and hopes of Allied victory to the east.,   Instead, the Allies were now in a position to exploit their successes.

Allied momentum was the building for the assault on the Ruhr Valley, and what was needed was a way across the mighty Rhine River. Knowing the Germans would not leave a bridge across the Rhine standing, Eisenhower had planned to take the entire western bank of the Rhine, and then begin bridging operations (under British General Montgomery) north of the Ruhr to launch the Allied main attack. But the events following Kesternich in the south would change Eisenhower's strategy and dramatically shorten the war.,   Following the landing at D-Day, the single most important event in the Allied drive on Berlin was the capture of the Ludendorff Bridge, commonly known as the \"Bridge at Remagen.\" Made of the best German steel, and named after the famous world war one leader, General Erich von Ludendorff, it was one of the finest spans over the Rhine. Thought built in world war one to allow Germans to strike west into Belgium and France, because of the actions of the 78th Division, it would soon become the main artery for Allied Forces striking east at the heart of Germany."},{"id":152816,"title":"The Bridge at Remagen","pos":[39.43976,-78.97698],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=152816","desc":"The Bridge at Remagen. . <blockquote> <i>\"The whole Allied force is delighted to cheer the U.S. First Army whose speed and boldness have won the race to establish our first bridgehead over the Rhine.

Eisenhower stood in disbelief that his forces were now pushing forward on the eastern shore of the Rhine, months ahead of when his staff had planned.,   For nine days the battered Bridge remained standing, allowed US Forces to pour into Germany. The 311th, 78th Division was the first Regiment across, and their bridgehead expanded, US Forces constructed six pontoons bridges adjacent to it, to ensure a steady flow of men and supplies across the Rhine. Continuously rocked by German attacks, the vibrations of US vehicles, and the effects of the initial German attempt at demolition, on March 17th, the Bridge at Remagen finally fell. But she had served her purpose - - American Forces were now spearheading an attack on the \"Berlin side of the Rhine,\" riding the coat tails of the 78th as it blazed the way into the heart of Germany.,   <i><small>Ken Heckler took first-hand accounts and conducted extensive interviews with the soldiers who took the Bridge, and wrote the premier account of the event.

His mother was a German war bride from world war one, and she currently had several brothers fighting in Hitler's Army. But, her oldest two sons were now fighting for the U.S. and one was about to become the first officer to attack across the Rhine since Napoleon. LT Timmerman had just taken command the day before and fate now handed him the chance to make history.,   The Bridge at Remagen was still standing on March 7 due to German confusion caused by American aggressiveness. Just three days earlier, Germans had blown two other bridges across the Rhine, one with US soldiers starting across it. Hitler had given orders not to leave a bridge standing across the Rhine, but he had also ordered his forces to hold the lines west of the Rhine.,   In the fog of war, such orders give little room for error. Blowing a bridge is one of the toughest decisions in war. There is such finality to it, stranding people on both sides of a large natural barrier. The conflict, the confusion, the hesitation, was all that the US Forces needed.,   Following Kesternich, the Germans were on the run. When LT Timmerman (9th Armored Division) and other US Forces (including the 78th) arrived on the hills around the town before some of the retreating GErmans, the Germans were in a bind. The Bridge Garrison did not want to destroy the Bridge with thousands of Germans still in need of crossing.,   On the American side, there were also conflicting orders. The Combat Commander, Brigadier General Hoge, had been told, \"When you get to the Rhine, turn south and hook up with Patton's Army.\" At first, US soldiers want to shell the retreating Germans on the Bridge, but when Hoge saw the Bridge, his gut told him differently. In spite of his orders, Hoge's American ingenuity told him opportunity was too good to pass up - - he gave Timmerman order to seize it instead.,   <center><i>\"Fate has mocked us, and black magic fights on the other side.\" , </i> <small>Sense of hopelessness collectively felt by German Commander and their staff after Remagen.. </small> ,   For the Germans at Remagen, things went terribly wrong. First, the rapidly approaching Americans pushed the Germans against the Rhine, creating a huge traffic jam of German soldiers, vehicles, equipment, and civilians (including domestic and farm animals, waiting to go across the bridge. Second, the unit occupying the most advantageous terrain in the vicinity of Remagen, the Erpeler Ley (the extremely high mountain directly overlooking the eastern end of the Bridge), was ordered to Koblenz on March 6th. When this incredible oversight came to the attention of Captain Braige, the German officer in charge of the Bridge on the morning of the 7th, he barked orders to the anti-aircraft gun commander to man the Erpeler Ley. Perhaps the dressing down of a \"lordly Luftwaffe officer\" by an infantry commander affected the speed of the execution, because when the Americans arrived, the observation point remained unmanned.,   But most dangerous of all, at 11:00 a.m. when the explosives arrived to be used in destroying the Bridge, there were only 300 kilograms as opposed to the 600 requested, and it was a weaker industrial explosive, not the standard military type. And finally at 11:15 a.m., SS officer unfamiliar with the situation and operations at the Bridge, Major Scheller, replaced Captain Bratge. Though relieved that higher headquarters was now paying attention to his plight. Bratge was devastated to learn Major Scheller did not bring with him the two battalions Bratge thought necessary to defend the Bridge.,   German engineers went to work placing the explosives on the Bridge, ensuring there were multiple means to detonate the charge. Bu 11:25, US Forces began attacking in the hills, and had started their descent into Remagen. By 12:50 p.m., Bratge and Scheller could hear US soldiers firing inside Remagen. The explosives were then in place, but Scheller knew several thousand German soldiers still planned to use the Bridge and a valuable artillery unit was now enroute to Remagen. He denied the Engineers request to blow the Bridge.,   At 2:00p.m., US tank and infantry fire was beginning to hit targets on the Bridge. When the German Engineers saw the first US helmets, they fired the preliminary charge, blowing a 30-foot crater across the Bridge approach. By 3:00 p.m., US tank and infantry began lining the western bank, hammering the eastern shore with fire. Rumors spread among the US Forces that the Germans planned to blow the Bridge at 4 p.m., increasing the urgency to take the Bridge immediately.,   Inside the Erple Tunnel on the German side, the German Engineers told everyone to open their mouths so as to protect their eardrums. Under intense fire, at 3:20 p.m., Major Scheller gave the order to blow the Bridge. The Engineer in charge turned the key, but nothing happened. Frantically, he sent his men out to fix the wiring. They got no further than the tunnel entrance before being turned back by US fire. Finally, one of his men volunteered to run out unto the Bridge and light the primer cord by hand. Back on the western shore, LT Timmerman began to give his men the order to move across the Bridge. Suddenly, a deafening roar blazed through the valley, and the Bridge lifted up off its foundation. The hand detonator had worked.,   \"Thank God, now we won't have to cross the damned thing,\" one GI said. Then, as the smoke cleared, to everyone's amazement - - German and American alike - - the Bridge settled back down on its foundations. It was still standing. ,  General Eisenhower's Chief of Staff"},{"id":152818,"title":"The Bridge at Remagen","pos":[39.43977,-78.97699],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=152818","desc":"The Bridge at Remagen. March 7, 1945.  ,  When the Germans tried to frantically reset the charges, American assertiveness took over. The on-scene commander, LT Timmerman began to send his men up onto the Bridge. He followed, right behind the first few men. One soldier, Joe DeLisio, moved faster than all the others, acting on the theory \"if you advance fast, enough you won't get hit.\" In fact he ran right past the towers on the eastern side from which the Germans were firing. When someone yelled \"Who's gonna clean out that tower?\" DeLisio took it as a challenge.,   Climbing on the top of the tower, DeLisio single-handedly took five Germans prisoner. Not wanting to have DeLisio stranded alone on the eastern side, Drabik took off at a run, ducking and weaving. When DeLisio threw the Germans' machine gun out a window into the river, many soldiers pinned down on the Bridge no began to move with confidence. By now, Drabik was at a dead run, and did not even stop to pick up his helmet when it bounced off his head. Thus, Drabik became the first man to reach the other side, followed closely by nine others, including Timmerman. Such was the thinking and camaraderie that carried the first US soldiers across the Bridge at Remagen.,   Commanders up through Bradley and Eisenhower were amazed at the development at the Bridge, and immediately began diverting all available units toward Remagen. The 78th was one of two Infantry Divisions already in Remagen, and before daylight on March 8th, the 311st was sent across with orders, \"When you get across, turn right and attack!\" The 311st became the first Regiment in its entirety to cross the Rhine.,   Germans fought desperately from the cliffs overlooking the Bridge on the eastern side, but the 78th came pouring across. Knowing the strategic blunder that leaving this Bridge intact would be, not to mention Hitler's wrath, German commanders tried everything conceivable to destroy the Bridge. They tried to shell it, bomb it, ram it, and even sent frogmen into the River to blow it - - but the Bridge remained standing. The significance of the Bridge at Remagen would be best understood by some of the ramifications on both Armies.,   <blockquote> <center><b><u>German</b></u>.  ,    . The failure of the Germans to destroy the Bridge was an immediate embarrassment to the entire German military ,   . Hitler recognized the significance, and directed huge reinforcements be moved from the other defensive points along the River to try to stop the US incursion at Remagen. ,   . Hitler convened a court-martial after the American crossing, and condemned five Nazi officers to death for their failures at the Bridge. ,   . Until Remagen, the Germans always knew there was a river between them and defeat. Behind the Rhine, they felt they could hold off the Allies, and negotiate a settlement. ,   . Following the War, German officers said they could accept losses at Avvanches, Utah Beach, and the Ardennes -- results of these were mathematical inevitabilities. These did not affect their pride. But when they lost the Bridge at Remagen, \"the Hitler Army reeled and its combat leaders became gutted of hope.\" ,   . The real significance of Remagen was the unrelenting blow, piercing deep into the German psyche. The people that were supposed to be so meticulous, such precise engineers, so meticulous in detail, had failed. The end was at hand.,   <center><u><b>American</b></u>.  ,    . Its seizure was estimated to have served the US \"5,000 dead and 10,000 wounded.\" ,   . The Bridge stayed in continuous use from the moment it was seized. When it fell on March 17th, it took 28 US soldiers to their death. ,   . With a portion of the eastern shore secure, the US quickly constructed six more bridges across the Rhine, and sent an unending stream of men and material straight into the heart of Germany. ,   . Eisenhower changed his main attack from Montgomery in the North to Bradley in the south base on the 78th's successes at Kesternich and Remagen. ,   .

The man's face is largely obscured by a hovering green apple. Another subtle feature is that the man's left arm appears to bend backwards at the elbow. About the painting Magritte said:,   <blockquote> \"At least it hides the face partly. Well, so you have the apparent face, the apple, hiding the visible but hidden. The face of the person, it's something that happens constantly. Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see. There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us.

Power, Control, and Profit.  ,  A company store provided an industrial community with the necessities of life, as well as a means for a company to control its workforce. Lured by the lucrative prospect of mining coal for steelmaking, Henry Gassaway Davis and other investors poured millions of dollars into rapidly building a community here. This sture ensured that the workforce would find the things they needed when they arrived, including food, clothing, tools, hardware, and other necessities. However, by paying in company scrip, a type of currency good only at stores owned by the H.G.

Thomas, West Virginia.  , <b>The Thomas National Register Historic District</b> is considered significant under Criterion A for its association with the settlement and development of Thomas and of Tucker County.,   Though remote, the area has been of interest to explorers for hundreds of years. It was Lord Fairfax who first put Tucker County on the map ,  literally ,  in 1736, when he sent a team of surveyors to map the boundaries of his vast land holdings in what is now the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia and northern Virginia. These men were some of the first Europeans to ever explore these remote mountains. In 1746, the Fairfax Stone was placed at the headwaters of the Potomac River to mark a corner of Lord Fairfax's land, only three miles from what would become Thomas. A young George Washington returned to survey the land again in 1746, but due to the difficult terrain and harsh weather, it was another 134 years until settlers decided to make Thomas their permanent home.,   Jacob C. Pase arrived from Pennsylvania with his family in the fall of 1880 and built a home on Rose Hill. In the next few years, more families followed, including Daniel Miller, David Arnold and John William Bonnifield. These men certainly must have been strong wills and constitutions. T. Nutter, in his 1906 history of the town of Thomas, dramatically notes in the early 1880s, \"Thomas was surrounded by a howling wilderness of pine and laurel, and wild beasts could be seen and killed from the very house doors.\" The first buildings were the quintessential cabins of mountain settlers, built from the most abundant resources available: trees. The small community was known as Fairfax in its early years, but thanks to that profusion of trees and an unseen wealth of coal buried below, big changes were in store for the little town, the least of which was a new name.,   <i>[Captions:]</i> ,  <small> The original survey for Lord Fairfax's land outlines an enormous tract reaching from the Chesapeake Bay to modern day Tucker County, shown with a red outline on this image for reference. The Fairfax Stone was placed just north of Thomas at the headwaters of the Potomac River, noted as \"Spring Head\" on the survey. (Source Library of Congress),   In just a few years, Thomas grew from a few homesteads to a town of hundreds, spurred by the arrival of the railroad and the coal industry. As seen in this 1906 bird's-eye view, the Thomas Commercial Historic District offered housing, shopping, entertainment and any other amenity a resident could desire. (Source: <i>Thomas, WV 1906</i> by T. Nutter, Courtesy Miners and Merchants Bank),   The quick growth of Thoms meant that many buildings were initially constructed as quickly as possible out of readily-available wood. In November 1901, a fire consumed 83 buildings in just a few hours, forever altering the appearance of the Thomas Commercial Historic District. Property owners rebuilt using primarily brick to guard against another such tragedy, and the Thomas Fire Department was formed to be better prepared. Here, fire chief Slim Fensler leads the department in a parade. (Courtesy Wilburn Fansier),   With the increase of available labor, tools and materials, buildings quickly evolved from the log cabins of the pioneers to multi-story structures with varied purposes. Here, workmen pose in the unfinished windows of the Tap Room, Tour No. 25. This structure was built after the fire of 1901 which destroyed nearly every building in the commercial district.

Thomas, West Virginia.  , <b>Thomas's National Register Significance</b> ,  <b>The Thomas Commercial Historic District</b> was listed as a National Register Historic District in 1997. In order to qualify for the National Register of Historic Place, a property must be at least 50 years old and meet at least one of the following criteria for historic significance:,   <b>A: Historical Events:</b> Properties that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history.,   <b>B: Important People:</b> Properties that are associated with significant people in our past.,   <b>C: Architecture and Design:</b> ,  Properties that embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method construction, or that represent the work of a matter, or that possess high artistic value. This includes historic districts in which the individual buildings may not have distinction, but as a group they are special.,   <b>D: Archaeology:</b> Properties that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. This criterion usually applies to archaeological sites.,   The Thomas Commercial Historic District is eligible for the National Register under Criteria A and C.,   The city is a fine example of a turn-of-the-century coal and railroad boom town. The arrival of the coal and railroad industries made Thomas a hub of commerce and culture for the surrounding region. It is also significant for its sizeable immigrant population, ethnic diversity and embodiment of the American \"melting pot.\",   The architecture of Thomas reflects a variety of styles, including Renaissance Revival, Greek Revival, Italianate, Gothic, and Craftsman. These buildings contained both businesses and residences, and unique features such as glass storefronts, balconies and rear yards.,   <b>What is Integrity?</b> ,  To qualify for the National Register of Historic Places, a building, property or district must have historic integrity, which means that people can still see and experience the important aspects of the property and that they haven't changed too much. There are seven aspects of integrity: location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.,   Determining if a place retains integrity depends upon the reasons it is historically significant. Though the buildings in Thomas have undergone some alterations, over the years, the commercial district retains most of its original buildings. It is still easy to imagine how Thomas appeared at its peak."},{"id":153060,"title":"Connecting Thomas to the World","pos":[39.15039,-79.49827],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=153060","desc":"Connecting Thomas to the World. Thomas, West Virginia.  , <b>The Railroad</b> ,  <b>The West Virginia Central and Pittsburg (<small>WVC&P</small>)</b> (Former Railyard, Tour No. 36) was founded by Henry Gassaway Davis, one of the most important figures in West Virginia history.,   Davis began his career as a brakeman and conductor for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and eventually undertook his own business ventures in railroads, coal and banking. Davis also served in the West Virginia legislature and United States Senate and was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in 1904.,   His company began building the <small>WVC&P</small> along the North Branch of the Potomac River in 1880 to access the natural resources in Tucker County. On August 10, 1884, the first train rolled into Fairfax, later renamed Thomas after Henry G. Davis's brother and business partner, Thomas B. Davis.,   The <small>WVC&P</small>'s structures around Thomas included a machine shop, roundhouse and freight depot, which are not part of the historic district and are no longer in existence. The brick passenger depot, built in 1900, was accessible only by foot via a wooden overpass and staircase until a road was built in 1925. Though these particular railroad structures no longer exist, the Thomas Commercial Historic District exists due to the railroad and is a continuing testament to its importance.,   In 1902, the <small>WVC&P</small> was sold and became part of the Western Maryland Railway. The railroad transitioned through several mergers, becoming part of the Baltimore and Ohio, Chesapeake and Ohio, and finally <small>CSX</small>. The last train traveled through Thomas in 1983.,   <b>An Essential Link</b> ,  The arrival of the railroad connected Thomas with the world and was responsible for the growth of the Thomas Commercial National Register Historic District.,   No longer was the area an isolated wilderness, accessible to only the hardiest explorers. People from all over the United States and Europe poured into town to work for the booming coal and timber industries, every one of them arriving by train.,   Daily trains took residents to Cumberland, Maryland and beyond for shopping and travel. Trains also brought all manor of goods and communication to the Thomas Commercial District,  imported food, new home appliances, the latest movies, newspapers, letters from friends and relatives, automobiles (Milkint's Garage, Tour No. 33) and even entire houses (residence, Tour No. 36) arrived by boxcar. Molly and Lil Schilansky, two sisters who operated a dress shop on East Avenue (Tour No. 5), frequently traveled to New York City to purchase the latest fashions for their customers.,   The building materials, including glass storefronts, carved wooden brackets, cornices, pressed tin ceilings and other items to construct almost every building in the historic district were brought by train. Most importantly, however, the railroad was the Davis Coal and Coke Company's essential link for converting coal to money."},{"id":153062,"title":"The Melting Pot of Thomas","pos":[39.15036,-79.49821],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=153062","desc":"The Melting Pot of Thomas. Thomas, West Virginia.  ,  <b>Immigration and Ethnic Diversity</b> ,  <b>After the railroad</b> and coal industries began operation, Thomas made a rapid transformation from isolated mountain town to small cosmopolitan city. The Davis Coal and Coke Company recruited workers from all over the world, and those workers in turn encouraged friends and family members to seek a better life in Thomas.,   Rocco D. Benedetto was instrumental in bringing many Italian families to Thomas. Benedetto was born in Pratola Peligna, Italy in 1864 and immigrated to the United STates in 1892. Like many immigrant laborers, he had to leave his wife and family behind in Italy. He started in the coal mines, working his way up from laborer to yard boss to coke inspector. His wife was finally able to join him in America in 1900. With his savings, Benedetto built two brick buildings and began publishing <i>La Sentinella del West Virginia,</i> an Italian newspaper with a statewide circulation of 3500. He also undertook a steamship ticket brokerage venture and visited Italy to recruit workers for the Davis Coal and Coke Company arranging their travel to America.,   It is estimated that as many as 18 nationalities were represented in Thomas including Italian, Russian, Lithuanian, Polish, Austrian, Irish and Swiss. The Davis Coal and Coke Company employed interpreters including Wladyslaw Dackiewicz from Poland, who spoke 8 languages. At its peak in the 1920s, Thomas had a population of over 2000 that included families such as DeCicco, DiBacco, DePollo, DiMaio, Dilettoso, Gennanonti, Grecco, Massi, Monda, Pinto, Quattro, Udovich, Gatto, Santangelo, Schilansky, Rubenstein, Geisberger and many others.,   The balconies on the Benedetto Building (No. 4) and other structures, inviting storefronts and shared common areas reflect the vibrant European street life that the immigrants could not help but bring with them. Though a sense of pride in family heritage persists in Thomas to this day, the residents of this city have always embraced their identity as Americans, as evidenced in the annual Fourth of July celebrations. Parades and festivities for Independence Day have been held in THomas since at least 1908. This holiday is marked by the many family and class reunions which draw far flung former residents back for the celebration."},{"id":153063,"title":"Out On The Town","pos":[39.15046,-79.49787],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=153063","desc":"Out On The Town. Thomas, West Virginia.  , <b>Social Life and Entertainment</b> ,  <b>Thomas</b> residents enjoyed a variety of entertainment and social activities.,   The town had many musicians, including Patsy Sangangelo, a gifted trumpet player and owner of a shoe repair shop (Tour No. 40). Patsy taught music lessons to many young people and his son Ralph became a professional musician in Los Angeles. The Thomas town band and a number of jazz ensembles played the local Imperial Hotel, dances and other venues.,   The Roma Restaurant (No. 39), with its upstairs dance hall, and the Varsity (No. 2), which had the first jukebox in town, were favorite hangouts for people of all ages. Historic photos of these spots evoke images of the classic soda fountain, authentic diner food, friendly conversation and neatly-dressed waitresses.,   Thomas also offered alternative opportunities for letting loose, described in some historical accounts as \"boozing, carousing and rowdyism.\" In 1912 alone, eight saloon licenses in the town were approved by the County Court.,   Several generations of the Thayer family operated a saloon in their building (No. 37) almost from the day Phoebe Thayer purchased the lot from the Davis Coal and Coke Company in 1983. This was in spite of the fact that the deed specifically prohibited the sale of alcohol on the property. The Sportsman's Club, run for many years by Phoebe's grandson Stuart Thayer, was famous for its taxidermy collection, particularly a semi-hidden mounted-rattlesnake that would startle the unsuspecting newcomer.,   <b>Contrill's Opera House and The Sutton Theater</b> ,  Hiram B. Cottrill, born in Harrison County in 1865, came to Thomas in 1887 to work for the Davis Coal and Coke Company. He left the coal business to start a saloon, but many of his buildings were destroyed in the 1901 fire. His Opera House (Tour No. 1) became a center of entertainment and culture not only for Thomas, but for many neighboring towns. Despite its name, the Opera House featured primarily vaudeville shows and movies and had an \"elegant saloon\" on its first floor.,   The Sutton family bought the theater in 1917 and operated it into the 1970s."},{"id":153066,"title":"A Lesson in Resourcefulness","pos":[39.15012,-79.49812],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=153066","desc":"A Lesson in Resourcefulness.

Hundreds of people from around the world came to Thomas to seek their fortunes, succeeding through hard work and determination. Today's residents of Thomas have fond memories of colorful citizens, kind shopkeepers always ready to slip a piece of candy to a child, beloved teachers and a multitude of other Thomasonians of the past. Here are just a few of those many stories.,   <b>Salvatore and Venanzio DiBacco</b> ,  Brothers Salvatore and Venanzio DiBacco were born in Italy, the sons of sheepherder Carmen DiBacco and his wife.,   Salvatore's autobiography, handwritten in 1960, recounts a difficult early life in 1960, recounts a difficult early life in Italy, but even in spite of hard times of hunger and poverty, the family took care of each other. Venanzio, finding his own options limited by illiteracy, insisted that his younger Salvatore be sent to school.,   Their sister Gaitana was married to Rocco Benedetto; in 1897 Rocco sent for Venanzio to come to Thomas, and Salvatore followed shortly after in 1898. The brothers worked so long, hard hours at the coke ovens, and all the while planning a more prosperous future. They went into business with Benedetto in 1901 but eventually fell into disagreement and parted ways with him, moving to a new location in 1915 (No. 3). Salvatore operated a grocery on the right side of the building and Venanzio ran a hardware store on the left side. Both families lived in the apartments above their stores.,   Salvatore's autobiography is full of colorful accounts of financial difficulties, extortion schemes, lawsuits, bouts with illness and even death threats, yet it also describes the happy occasions of births and marriages, the growth of business and prosperity, the establishment of a \"Society for Mutual Help\" to assist neighbors in difficult times and the achievement of Salvador's fondest wish ,  to give all his children the opportunity of an education.,   <b>Mary Geisberger and Phoebe Thayer</b> ,  In his 1906 history of Thomas, T. Nutter gave high praise to Mary Geisberger (Tour No. 7) and Phoebe Thayer (Tour Nos. 28 and 37), who achieved considerable success before women even gained the right to vote. Nutter wrote the following biographical sketches of the two women:,   <blockquote><i> \"A more business-like woman is not to be met than the subject of this sketch, Mrs. Mary (Iberg) Geisberger, who was born in Switzerland, Nov. 20, 1856. She was united in marriage with Mr. Robert Geisberger at the age of twenty-one. ,  \"In 1879, she, with her husband, emigrated from Switzerland to Alpena, then a new settlement in Randolph County, West Virginia, where for a long time Mr. Geisberger engaged in farming. From Alpena they moved to Lonaconing, Maryland, where they engaged in the boarding house business, and followed a like business for the West Virginia Central and Pittsburg Railway Company along its line of construction. That road was completed to Thomas in August of 1884, when the Geisbergers opened a hotel here. ,  \"�Mrs. Geisberger owns considerable property and is, perhaps, the heaviest individual tax payer in Thomas. She retired from active business in 1900, and now lives in private apartments at the Hotel Metropolitan, which building she owns.\",   \"No woman in Thomas deserves more credit than does Mrs. P.E. (Hoover) Thayer, who was born in Pendleton county, West Virginia, in 1862. She married at the age of nineteen to Mr. Richard H. Thayer of Oakland, Maryland. After a short residence in Oakland, they moved to Winona, Logan county, Kansas, where they conducted a hotel. In June, 1887, they came to Thomas, where Mr. Thayer now mines coal for the Davis Coal and Coke Company. Wholly through Mrs. Thayer's labors, economy and business ability, she has accumulated considerable property. In the great fire of 1901 she lost four buildings. Not to be daunted by this loss, she only built greater, and now not only owns good property in Thomas, but property of much value in Winona, Kansas. </blockquote></i> ,   <b>Jim Cooper</b> ,  Jim Cooper, Jr. was a fixture on East Avenue for almost 70 years. He lived at 114 East Avenue (No. 14) and owned a men's clothing store at the Cooper Building (No. 9). His father Jim Cooper, Sr. got into the clothing business in nearby davis when a local man who was being drafted talked Jim Sr. into \"temporarily\" buying his clothing store. Although they later discovered the man had actually been trying to sell the business for 6 months, the Coopers had a number of good years before the economy in Davis took a downturn around 1919. A number of factors forced the Coopers to close the store in Davis, but Jim, Jr., who had assisted his father from an early age, believed there was a market for finer \"weekend\" clothing for the miners in nearby Thomas. He rented a shop in the Opera House building (No. 1) and began selling suits. He later moved the business to the Cooper Building, and eventually bought that property around 1948.,   Jim became known for his excellent fitting and measuring abilities, and sold fine brands and the latest fashionable styles. He was also known for his punctuality; neighbors could set their clocks by Jim's morning, lunch break and evening walks between his home and shop.

Thomas, West Virginia.  , <b>Residential Architecture in Thomas</b> ,  <b>Modern society</b> places value on home ownership, especially a house with land. However, families that moved from Europe or large cities such as New York in the early 20th century were not necessarily accustomed to single-family houses or large yards. In Thomas, many preferred apartment life, conveniently located right above their businesses and close to all the amenities that East Avenue had to offer.<br. ,   The families living in the Benedetto Building (No. 4), the DiBacco Building (No. 3) and others formed a tight-knit community and shared a common rear yard where the women washed clothes and children played together. In the days before automobile travel and improved roads, it made little sense to live any farther than necessary from the railroad depot, shops and doctors in town.,   In the rapidly changing early years of the 20th century, industrialization created more wealth for a growing middle class and a concern about the health of city life. These factors and others led to rise of the suburb and single-family homes. Soon home ownership became the American Dream.,   The transition between higher density apartment homes and lower-density houses is readily seen by simple looking uphill in Thomas. East Avenue contains one house (No. 14) and one duplex (No. 16). Both these houses are influenced by the Gothic Revival style that was popular beginning around 1850. Over half of the buildings located on Spruce Street today are single-family homes and generally reflect styles popular in the early 1900s such as Craftsman (No. 31) and American Foursquare (Nos. 26, 29 and 30). The streets above Spruce are almost exclusively filled with houses.,   Thomas's domestic architecture is a timeline of changing American values and architectural trends.,   <b>Choices in Housing</b> ,  Two of the original Jewish families to settle in Thomas demonstrate two different approaches to residential architecture.,   Barney Schilansky immigrated from Russia to New York in the 1870 with his wife Sarah. He traveled throughout the Southeastern United States selling goods as a pack peddler and after visiting Thomas, decided it was a promising place to move his wife and daughter Celia. They arrived in 1886 and Barney continued door-to-door peddling until he had saved enough to build a general store.,   Sarah's sister Annie and her husband Victor Rubenstein who had met in New York in the 1870s, joined the Schilanskys in thomas in 1894, and the two families formed a close-knit association. Barney's daughter Celia married Victor's son Ruby and the two families operated various businesses including meat markets, grocery stores and clothing shops.,   The Schilansky-Rubenstein Building (No. 6) housed both families in two large apartments, as large as any single-family house. The home became the center of the Jewish community in Thomas, hosting weddings, worship and holy day observances.<Br> ,   The Schatz brothers, George and Harry, also arrived as peddlers in 1886 and were later joined by their brother Isaac. The 1909 Schatz home on Spruce Street (No. 28) is one of the largest houses in the historic district. The style of the house is folk Victorian, with a cross-gabled roof, large wraparound porch and fine interior woodwork.,   Though the Schilansky/Rubenstein and Schatz families had much in common and undoubtedly were well-acquainted, they each chose different building types to house their families."},{"id":153083,"title":"Thomas, West Virginia Mine Disaster Memorial","pos":[39.14948,-79.49834],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=153083","desc":"Thomas, West Virginia Mine Disaster Memorial. .

People from surrounding towns visited Thomas for their shopping needs. Many business owners were immigrants who started as laborers in the mines or as pack peddlers, and patiently saved until they build buildings and open their own businesses. The population of Thomas at the turn of the century truly represents the classic American Dream of prosperity through hard work.,   Thomas grew quickly between 1884 and 1990. However, the appearance of the town drastically changed in 1901 due to a destructive fire that broke out in the early hours of November 12. Eighty-three buildings were destroyed in two hours due to the 50 mile per hour winds that spread the fire quickly. Most of the buildings had originally been constructed of wood thanks to the wealth of trees located in the hills around Thomas. After the fire, most property owners decided to take no chances and rebuilt using brick.,   <b>Joseph DePollo, Shopkeeper</b> ,  Joseph DePollo immigrated to the United States from Italy in 1891. He was recruited in the New York to come to Coketon as a worker for the Davis every year until he could bring them back to Thomas around 1903, the same year he opened his general store in a small wooden building on Front Street.,   The present building (No. 15) was constructed in 1915-16 and the family of 10 lived on the upper floors. Joe's son John began working at age 14 as a delivery boy and went on to help his father manage the store. He became owner when his father died and tended the store for over 50 years, even as the coal industry faltered and the population declined.,   DePollo's store features expansive glass storefronts and plenty of shelves to display merchandise. The store also served as kind of clubhouse, where men would gather for a beer and the latest news. The current roof over the sidewalk replaced the original overhanging enclosed porch which was supported on slender metal columns.,   <b>Buildings as Ads</b> ,  In the era before television and radio advertising, the building was the business owner's way of communicating with customers. One of the best ways to entice bypassers into a shop was to display goods in large glass storefronts, which can be seen in almost every building on East Avenue. Commercial architecture of the early 20th century reference architectural styles of the past using new materials in an economical way. For example, most of Thomas's buildings have symmetrical window patterns on their front facades and at least a simple cornice at the top, which reflect principles of ancient Greek architecture. Brick, an inexpensive material, was laid in decorative patterns to resemble columns, cornices, arches and other architectural features. Though constructing a blank brick wall would surely have been less expensive, it was smarter marketing to put one's best face forward. The rise of factory manufacturing also allowed affordable production of decorative materials such as pressed tin ceilings, machine-carved woodwork, metal facades and concrete cast to look like stone. These items could be ordered from catalogs and shipped by train in modular pieces so that a shop owner could easily \"dress up\" his building."},{"id":153089,"title":"Thomas Underground","pos":[39.14809,-79.49931],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=153089","desc":"Thomas Underground. Thomas, West Virginia. <b> , Coal and Its Impact on Thomas</b> ,  <b>The history</b> of the coal industry is inextricable from the development of the Thomas Commercial Historic District. If the Davis brothers had not invested in coal mining and transportation in the area, the town and buildings we know today would not exist.,   Henry Gassaway Davis was born in Woodstock, Maryland in 1823. He overcame the early death of his father and financial hardships, beginning a successful career with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at age 20. By the 1858 Davis had saved enough money to begin buying property with potential for coal and timber. Over the years, the Davis Brothers, including William and Thomas, built a powerful empire in railroads, natural resources and politics.,   In 1884, prospectors for H.G. Davis and Bros. discovered the Kittanning seam of coal between Thomas and Davis and a mine was opened. In 1887, two coke ovens were constructed and the Freeport seam of coal was found to be excellent for making coke. The company, which also included Davis's son-in-law Stephen B. Elkins, was reorganized as the Davis Coal and Coke Company in 1888.,   Coking is a process in which coal is burned without oxygen, driving off water and volatile gasses. Coke is essential for steel-making, which at the time was one of the largest industries in the United States and was centered in western Pennsylvania, not far from Thomas. When coal and coke production began in Thomas, the town became a gear in an immense industrial machine, powering steel mills that built America's cities and skyscrapers, building the rails and bridges that connected coasts, and fueling factories, locomotives and steamships. The Davis Coal and Coke Company had over 500 brick beehive coke ovens burning at the height of production. The company town was called Coketon, and was located adjacent to the town of Thomas. Coketon included a company store, employee housing, schools and other structures and services, but because of its proximity to Thomas and the area's sizeable population, many coal company employees also shopped, spent time and lived in Thomas.,   New technologies rendered the coke ovens obsolete in 1915, but coal continued to be mined through the 1940s. Although the 15-mine operation surrounding Thomas was the sixth most productive area in the state, only one mine disaster occurred over the course of its history: an explosion killing 25 on February 4, 1907. From 1915 to 1921, 1 million tons of coal annually were shipped out of the Thomas/Coketon mines. The coal industry started a slow decline through 1950, when only two underground mines were still in operation. The last underground mine closed in 1956.,   <b>Working the Mines</b> ,  Mining and coking were exhausting jobs, not for the weak or faint of heart. Salvatore DiBacco (associated with Tour Nos. 2, 3 and 4) started work in the coke ovens as a teenager, the day after he arrived in Thomas from Italy in 1889. He described the experience in his autobiography:,   <blockquote><i> \"After a good night a fellow country man told me if I wanted to go work with him. I did not know where we were going about 1/4 mile we stopped, and it was coke ovens. The front wall of the furnace, he stack a long pipe with water sprinkles on the coal then he turned the water on and this was how they made coke, with big blazes of fire blowing out of each furnace as you put water on the coke. If you did not watch out you could easy get yourself burn. As you got the coke cooled down you began to draw the coke from each oven this was hot and tiresome job but after you get used to this, it was not such a bad job.\" </blockquote></i> ,   Salvatore received 48 cents a day for cleaning one coke oven. Later, when he began working as a merchant, he always kept the memory of the hot, exhausting nights working the ovens as incentive to make his store successful."},{"id":153092,"title":"The Story of a River / Life in a Coal Mining Town","pos":[39.14911,-79.49906],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=153092","desc":"The Story of a River, also, Life in a Coal Mining Town. . <center><b>The Story of a River. </b>   Welcome to the Thomas Interpretive Area. During the 19th century this area was renowned as a remote, forlorn wilderness, but the discovery of coal in the region and the advent of the Industrial Age, became a center of coal and coke production.,   Mining and coking levied a heavy toll on the Blackwater River Valley. Water seeping through mining areas leached acid into the river devastating aquatic wildlife. Massive amounts of crushed limestone were used to neutralize the acidity and restore the health of the river. Thanks to an extensive clean-up effort, the Blackwater River is reclaiming its historic legacy as one of the most beautiful rivers in the country.,   <i><blockquote> After traversing the thicket, they reached a stream about forty feet wide, and of inconsiderable depth, completely hemmed in by laurel and beautifully arched with evergreens, so dense and dark that it had a cavernous look.,   The Black Fork of Cheat, where our party stood, was about two hundred feet in width, and poured its amber flood at an angle of some seven or eight degrees, over a bed of monstrous boulders, and between mountain walls a thousand or twelve hundred feet in height.,   Conway, however, who had gone over to the Blackwater, returned with about a hundred and fifty fine trout.  <small>Harpers New Monthly Magazine, Volume III, December 1853 to May, 1854  The Virginian Canaan, By A Virginian </blockquote></i> </small>  A prolific illustrator between the years of 1850 and 1879, David Hunter Strother, or Porte Crayon as he signed his work, was widely recognized for his illustrations chronicling the Civil War and the people of the South.

The war ruined Hammond, a strong Southern sympathizer.,   In October 1859, Hammond�s son George Newkirk &#8220;Kirk&#8221; Hammond (1833-1864), a Virginia Military Institute graduate, rushed to Martinsburg to join the county militia when he learned of John Brown�s Raid at Harpers Ferry. Capt E.G. Alburtis led his company to the town, where the men freed some of Brown�s hostages and forced the raiders to withdraw into the Armory engine house (now called Brown�s Fort). One of Brown�s men wounded Hammond during the action. When the Civil War began, Hammond joined Co. J.E.B. Stuart�s 1st Virginia Cavalry and became captain of Co. B, the Berkeley Troop. He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Yellow Tavern on May 11, 1864, as was Stuart, who died the next day. Hammond died six days after the battle and is buried in the Confederate Officers� section of Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.,   During the Antietam Campaign in 1862, Confederate Gen. Thomas J. &#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson�s men camped here on September 11. They had just captured the Federal garrison at North Mountain Depot north of Martinsburg, cutting the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and thereby preventing the Union forces at Harpers Ferry from escaping by rail. ,   Confederate Gen. John McCausland began his July 1864 cavalry raid into Pennsylvania from this house. He burned Chambersburg in retaliation for the Federal destruction of houses in the Shenandoah Valley, one of many such retaliations on both sides.,   <small> After the war, Dr. Hammond asserted that Union forces often used his 22-room mansion as a hospital. An excerpt from a report written by Lt. Richard G. Prendergast, 1st New York Cavalry, appears to support Hammond's claim. Prendergast had attacked and pursued a detachment of the 7th Virginia Cavalry, wounding and capturing 13 of them: \"<i>Headquarters Cavalry Picket, Hammond's House, Va., December 11, 1862. � I pursued them to the base of Bunker Hill, when, seeing that they were supported by the rest of that regiment, drawn up on the crest of that hill, I halted, and returned unpursued, by Martinsburg, here.

Caught in the Midst of Conflict. Life in Beverly changed following the Union victory at Rich Mountain on July 11, 1861. Many of the community�s outspoken Southern sympathizers fled south. Some of those who remained resented the hardship that came with Union occupation, although Laura Ann Jackson Arnold, Stonewall Jackson�s sister, gladly cared for wounded Federal solders under her roof. Travel was restricted, many townspeople were compelled to board soldiers, and some had their property taken or destroyed by the army.,  \tAware of the strategic importance of Beverly for control of the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike, Union garrisons were maintained here to support actions throughout western Virginia.

Imboden began a raid from Virginia through present-day West Virginia against the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Taking separate routes, they later reported that they marched 1,100 miles, fought several engagements, captured 100 Federals, seized about 1,200 horses and 4,000 cattle, and burned 4 turnpike bridges, more than 20 railroad bridges, 2 trains, and 150,000 barrels of oil. Most bridges were soon repaired. Confederate losses were slight. By May 26, both commands had returned to Virginia�s Shenandoah Valley., On April 23, 1863, Gen John D. Imboden and his 3,300 cavalrymen rested here in the Tygart Valley after marching from Bartow 23 miles southeast on the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike. En route, they had waded the frigid, slush-filled Greenbrier River and then crossed Cheat Mountain where deep snow had fallen the night before. Now they prepared to attack Beverly.,   \tImboden was uncertain how many Federals were at the town and whether or not they knew of his impending attack. Capt. Joseph French Harding, who had attended school at the Huttonsville Academy, led a scouting party to the town. As they returned at dawn on April 24, Harding�s men encountered the Randolph County sheriff, Jesse Frank Phares, desperately riding north on the turnpike to warn the Federals at Beverly. Harding later wrote, &#8220;{I} ran on to the road and fired directly after him. We knew at the time that he was wounded, but he pluckily kept his saddle until reaching the Federal pickets at the bridge about two miles distant, and there gave them their first information of our advance.&#8221;,  \tHarding reported that there were 1,100 Federal soldiers in Beverly. Imboden had already ordered his troops to start the twelve-mile march to the town. He divided his command into two columns near the present site of Dailey, advancing down both sides of the Tygart River. Thick fog in the valley obscured their movements until 1 P.M. By 5 P.M., the Federals had started to retreat from Beverly to Philippi., <i>(Sidebar):</i> The 25th and 31st Virginia Infantry regiments were formed here at Huttonsville on June 14, 1861. They were part of Confederate Gen. Robert S. Garnett's Army of the Northwest. When Imboden wrote to Gen. Robert E. Lee in March 1863 of his plans for an invasion of northwestern Virginia, he asked for these regiments: \"These two old regiments are from the northwest ... and would fight like tigers the vandals who have so long domineered over their helpless families.\" On April 9, Lee ordered the two regiments from eastern Virginia by railroad to Staunton to join the raiders."},{"id":155087,"title":"Camp Elkwater","pos":[38.62862,-80.02732],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=155087","desc":"Camp Elkwater.

The town gets its name from Jacob Marlin who arrived here in 1749 with Stephen Sewell and built a cabin near the mouth off the Greenbrier River. This established the site as the first English settlement west of the Alleghenies. After a disagreement over religion, Sewell moved into a hollow sycamore tree, and Col. Andrew Lewis discovered the two on this spot in 1751 while surveying for the Greenbrier Company.,   Marlinton remains the business center of Pocahontas County and is home to the Pocahontas County Historical Society and Museum. The McClintic Library serves as the home base for the Award-winning Pocahontas County Free Libraries and houses The Heritage Room and the Appalachian Collection. Marlinton�s people continue the tradition of &#8220;rolling out the welcome mat&#8221; for visitors who come year round to explore their family history and to enjoy the wild beauty of the surrounding area. ,   <b>Sharp�s Tunnel Bridge</b> ,   Upon the arrival of the train in Marlinton in 1900, the push continued to finish the line to Cass. The West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company was eager to ship pulpwood to the new paper mill in Covington, Virginia. A temporary bridge was built across the Greenbrier River at Sharp�s Tunnel north of Marlinton. High water on the night off November 25, 1900, took out the bridge and damaged the grade above the tunnel. The girders to replace the bridge arrived in Marlinton in December, but had come up the line wrong end foremost. A wye track was quickly constructed. The girders were maneuvered into the proper direction. Once the girders arrived, the Sharps Tunnel Bridge was ready for use by the end of the week. On January 22, 1901, a special train consisting of three private cars carried the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway executives to Cass. ,   <b>C&0 Train at Marlinton Station</b> ,   Passenger trains during the early days had very few miles between stops. Existing communities coupled with the new sawmill towns gave rise to the saying that &#8220;a train had to back up after leaving a station in order to have enough distance to whistle for the next station.&#8221; With the development of the lumber industry, ridership increased rapidly. In 1906-1907 trains on the Greenbrier Line carried 139,848 passengers generating revenue of $93,147. Marlinton was the busiest station that year with 24,941 riders boarding the train. ,   <b>Marlinton Freight Depot</b> ,   The Marlinton freight depot was constructed in 1905. Once a community was connected to the national rail network, almost everything came by train. This included the everyday material needs of the Upper Greenbrier Valley. Carloads of coal, food, retail goods, farm supplies and household furnishings, as well as mail, newspapers and items ordered from catalogs were all delivered to by rail. Even the first automobiles and the fuel to power them came by rail. One of the busiest stations was Marlinton with close to 50,000 tons of freight in 1907. ,   <b>A Party at The Opera House</b> ,   The first Opera House in Marlinton, known as &#8220;The Grand,&#8221; began showcasing vaudeville acts, dramatic productions and moving picture shows in 1907. The second and larger Opera House, on Third Avenue, towers above other buildings in town reminding us of the impact of the railroad. Built in 1910 by J.G. Tilton, the three-story concrete structure boasted a large stage and wrap-around balcony. The glory days of this grand facility were short lived as Mr. Tilton ran into financial trouble and the building was sold in 1914. It was used for car sales and lumber storage for many years. The building has been restored by the local Historic Landmarks Commission, and is used today as a performing arts center. Thanks to Ruth Morgan and others who brought this &#8220;Grand&#8221; hall back to life. ,   <b>Building the Railroad</b> ,   The Chesapeake and Ohio construction of the Greenbrier Railway through Marlinton began in 1899 along the Greenbrier River south of Stillhouse Run. Construction crews are reported to have used mules, wagons, and tents that were army surplus from the Spanish-American War. It is estimated that 1,500 men were at work within a few months. The construction train pictured belonged to the Greenbrier River Railroad Company and was used to haul materials for the work. The official &#8220;first train&#8221; arrived in Marlinton on October 26, 1900. The entire town turned out in their finery for the daylong celebration. ,   <b>Greenbrier Division Freight Train</b> ,   Freights on the Greenbrier Line were most commonly powered by Chesapeake and Ohio Class G 2-8-0 locomotives. The number of trains and their schedules depended on the level of business available. Many times the trains were freight only, no passengers. Freight trains were often run as &#8220;extra&#8221; and did not appear on the timetable. Part of the freight hauled was the bark used in the tanning process at the tanneries in Marlinton and Frank. Even though the sawmills would begin to close by 1910, the Cass operation of the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company would continue to keep trainloads of lumber, pulpwood and slabs moving along the Greenbrier Line into the early 1920�s. ,   <b>Calvin W. Price ,  1880-1957</b> ,  One of Marlinton�s most prominent citizens was Calvin Wells Price, longtime Editor of The Pocahontas Times. The first newspaper in the county and the only one in publication today, the Times holds the distinction of being the last handset commercial newspaper in America. &#8220;The typical country editor,&#8221; Cal Price was known far and wide for both his &#8220;Field Notes&#8221; and panther tales. A leading figure in the conservation movement, Price served as the first president of the West Virginia Wildlife Federation.

He left the army to become the Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and Instructor of Artillery at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia. ,   Jackson led cadets to Charles Town in 1859 to provide security at John Brown�s execution. After the war began in April 1861, Jackson�s first command was at Harpers Ferry, where he formed and trained one of most famous units in the Civil War, the Stonewall Brigade. Both Jackson and his brigade earned their nickname at the First Battle of Manassas in July 1861. Jackson also acquired Little Sorrel, his favorite mount for the rest of his life, while he was here.,   Jackson returned here in September 1862 and captured Harpers Ferry and 12,500 Union soldiers to eliminate a potential Union threat to the rear of Gen.

On the highest hill in the immediate area, Mulligan constructed what appeared to be an impregnable fortress.  ,  Colonel Mulligan commanded the garrison here at Petersburg during the summer and fall of 1863, having at one time 68 officers, 1532 men and 7 pieces of field artillery. Mulligan left Petersburg in November to return to New Creek. He was replaced by Colonel Joseph Thoburn who took command of the fort.  ,  Sent east to Winchester, Mulligan was wounded while leading a charge at the battle of Kernstown on July 24, 1864. While being carried off the field he noticed that the colors of his brigade were endangered. &#8220;Lay me down and save the flag,&#8221; he ordered. His men hesitated, but finally obeyed. Before they returned, he had been bourn away by the enemy and died a prisoner in Winchester, Virginia on July 26, 1864. Mulligan had been brevetted a Brigadier General of Volunteers just a few weeks earlier. ,  <b>Captain John H. McNeill, CSA</b> John Hanson McNeill was born June 12, 1815, a short distance from Moorefield. In April of 1861, he was commissioned by Missouri Governor Jackson to raise a company of militia and join General Price. Twice commended for bravery, McNeill was wounded at Lexington and later captured, along with his son Jesse. After a daring escape from prison, McNeill and his son returned to Hardy County and once again tool up the cause of the Confederacy.  ,  Captain McNeill�s company of 1st Virginia Partisan Rangers was accepted into Confederate service on September 24, 1862. It was merged into the 18th Virginia Cavalry, and then part of McNeill�s command was reassigned in February of 1863. The other section remained under McNeill�s personal command. Few groups were more effective that the some 210 men of the McNeill Rangers. Hardy County served as their main base of operations. <i><b>The McNeill Rangers</b></i> were considered &#8220;bushwhackers&#8221; by many Union generals as they pursued their objectives, creating general havoc among the Federal troops, disrupting traffic and communications on the B&O Railroad, and foraging for beef cattle to supply the Confederate armies.  ,  On October 3, 1863, having learned of a wagon train bringing supplies to Union troops around Harrisonburg, the McNeill Rangers attacked a force of Federals guarding the bridge over the Shenandoah. They captured the bridge and some 60 Union prisoners, but in the confusion McNeill was mortally wounded. He was taken to the home of a Methodist minister where, knowing they were in danger of capture, he said &#8220;Goodbye, my boys, leave he to my fate. I can do no more for my country.&#8221; He was later smuggled to Harrisonburg where he died November 10, 1864. The McNeill Rangers continued under the leadership of his son Jesse, who never forgot what his father taught him, in leading a raid, one should always look well for a getting-out-place before going in. ,  <b><i>&#8220;we will fight to the last crust or cartridge&#8221;</i> , Mulligan�s Men, April 1863</b> ,   , <b><i>Military Events near Petersburg, WV</i></b> ,  <b>June 2, 1861</b> &#8211; <i><b>The South Branch Riflemen</b></i>, a Confederate company organized in Hardy and Pendleton counties and commanded by <i><b>Captain John H.

The Federal troops found a Rebel signal station. From the top, Petersburg and Moorefield could be viewed. There was no sign of <i><b>McNeill�s</b></i> Confederate forces. ,  <b>January 11&#8211;15, 1865</b> &#8211; Union <i><b>Major Elias S.

The Federal cavalry moved up the North Fork and arrived at the Mouth of Seneca on the 13th. <i><b>Captain Boggs,</b></i> of the <i><b>Home Guards</b></i>, and 40 men joined <i><b>Troxel</b></i> for an attack on the Confederates at Franklin. The Rebels learned of the impending attack and fled to the mountains. The Union troops retraced their steps back to Petersburg and encountered <i><b>McNeill�s</b></i> command who fired on them from the mountain sides. ,  ,  <i><b>The Civil War Comes to Hardy County</b></i> ,  Hardy County was one of the constantly disputed sections of western Virginia during the Civil War. Many in present Hardy County favored the Southern cause, but some remained loyal to the Union. Many who lived in present Grant County considered themselves Unionists, but some Confederate sympathizers lived in that section, too. Both sides wanted the produce of this rich agricultural region. ,  Western Virginia was rich in farm crops, livestock and salt, all of which were in short supply during the war. Confederate commanders coveted western Virginia, not only for its abundance of supplies, but also as a vast recruiting ground. They also realized that the B&O Railroad was the main supply line of troops and supplies for the Union Army and made numerous attempts to gain control of the railroad. ,  The North and the South were both quick to realize the value of western Virginia as a military base from which they could attack vital enemy positions. The strategic location of Petersburg is quite apparent. It lays in a main intersection, with north leading to New Creek (Keyser) and Cumberland, west to Grafton, east to Winchester and the Shenandoah Valley, and south towards Franklin and Staunton. This is why Petersburg was used as an auxiliary supply depot so far south of New Creek, which was the main supply depot for the Union Armies. ,  The South Branch Valley was occupied by Confederate forces as early as August of 1861. They were driven out in September as a result of skirmishes with Federal troops from New Creek. Until April of 1862, the area remained a &#8220;no man�s land&#8221; with both sides patrolling and for short period occupying the overlooking hills. Roughly 20,000 Federal troops under the command of Major General John C. Fremont invaded the South Branch Valley in April of 1862. Using Petersburg as a base Freemont covered the area. In May, troops from Milroy�s and Schenck�s Brigades of Freemont�s Mountain Department were defeated by Confederates under Stonewall Jackson at McDowell and fell back to their base here. When Freemont�s army headed to the Shenandoah Valley in pursuit of Jackson, this area again saw patrols and occasional occupation by both sides.  McNeill�s Rangers was a company of Confederates who operated with impunity in the area and did much to thwart Federal efforts to protect the B&O Railroad. Their many small actions, along with larger scale incursions by regular Confederate cavalry resulted in a more determined effort on the part of Federal forces to hold the South Branch Valley. ,  The battles fought in these mountain regions differed greatly from the eastern battlefields. There was no large-scale carnage such as at Antietam and Gettysburg; however, these battles, skirmishes and affairs were fought with the same valor and determination. The valleys, hills and mountains of West Virginia echoed with the thunder of guns throughout the Civil War. By November of 1864, the Shenandoah Valley was under complete Federal control, but this area continued to be dangerous territory for Federal troops until the war ended."},{"id":155441,"title":"Welcome to Fort Mulligan Civil War Site","pos":[39.00148,-79.1391],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=155441","desc":"Welcome to Fort Mulligan Civil War Site. .  ,  <b>Exploring Fort Mulligan.</b>  A trail system with interpretive exhibits describe the Fort�s construction, usage and strategic importance during the Civil War.

Mulligan,</b></i> from Chicago, Illinois. Infantry, cavalry and artillery from West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Illinois carried out the backbreaking labor. ,  Known locally as <i><b>Fort Hill,</b></i> the Fort was to serve as protection for the South Branch Valley from Confederate forces and also as an auxiliary depot to supply numerous Union troops on their expeditions. The Fort was built on the same ground which had previously been fortified camps in October of 1861, and May and June of 1862. ,  Constructed of dirt earthworks, the Fort�s inner walls were lined with timber. A defensive barrier of cut trees, known as an abatis, was on the outer entrenchment walls to prevent a major assault. There are indications of as many as three entrances and at least seven gun emplacements.

This valuable historical information was provided by Elizabeth Davis Swiger who edited the letters and diary of Winters. ,  <b>A Struggle for Control.</b> The valley of the South Branch of the Potomac River saw an incredible amount of troop activity and action during the Civil War. Federal or Confederate troops occupied this hill and its surrounding area as early as August of 1861, and were on the grounds for at least part of every year of the war. Federal forces time and again tried to use this strategic point as a choke hold against raids on the B&O Railroad to the north, and as a &#8220;jumping-off&#8221; point for their own raids further south. Foraging wagon trains were continually sent out in all directions and almost all of the Union expeditions against the Confederate forces were supplied from the depot at Petersburg. Many expeditions were reinforced with soldiers from Fort Mulligan. ,  The Fort was evacuated on January 31, 1864, by Union <i><b>Colonel Joseph Thoburn</b></i> due to an impending attack by Confederate <i><b>General Jubal Early,</b></i> who stated that his men &#8220;demolished the works....&#8221; For the remainder of 1864 and 1865, sharp action continued sporadically in the area, but Fort Mulligan was never again occupied as a garrison. ,  The rugged earthworks before you bear silent witness to the sacrifices of thousands of Americans who marched, dug, fought, froze and died here during the war.

Confederate General Early indicated that these works were very impressive and that a small force with artillery could have held the Fort against his larger force. ,  Before you is a full-scale replica of a Napoleon 12-pounder cannon. The Napoleon was originally developed in France in the 1850s and was named after Emperor Napoleon III. Most barrels were made of bronze and others were made of iron. This one has been cast in iron.  ,  Napoleons were used by both Union and Confederate troops during the Civil War. The Federal tube was characterized by a muzzle swell and the Confederate tube was smooth and straight without the swell. Called the &#8220;workhorse&#8221; of Civil War artillery, the Napoleon was designed to fire shot, shell,\tcase shot and canister.

This group of hut emplacements was much smaller and more isolated than the other infantry camps. Log huts were built into the hillside and partially covered with dirt. Roofs were usually canvas shelter cloths; floors and sometimes chimneys were made from bricks taken from local churches burned during the war. ,  One of these churches, the Petersburg (Union) Methodist Church on the North Fork Road, was destroyed by Federal troops in 1861.

They had taken separate routes before uniting at Buckhannon and then coming here to rest, round up stragglers, and await reinforcements from Beverly. On May 6, they separated to continue the raid, with Jones heading west toward Parkersburg while Imboden rode south to Sutton., Weston was important for its location at the junction of two major highways, the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike and the Weston and Gauley Bridge Turnpike. The town endured two other Confederate raids besides the Jones-Imboden Raid, including one by Gen. Albert G. Jenkins in August 1862, when he destroyed the telegraph line here.

Jackson�s men, who had suffered from extreme cold and heavy snow throughout the campaign, appreciated access to warm, dry clothing and rations. ,  \tWhile Jackson occupied White�s house, he laid plans to pursue the Federal force and telegraphed the Confederate War Department to request additional troops, including cavalry. He hoped to capture Cumberland, Maryland, but when reinforcements were not forthcoming, he planned instead simply to continue west and destroy the railroad bridge at New Creek Station (present-day Keyser). Morale among the men was so low, however, especially in Gen. William W. Loring�s brigades, that Jackson reluctantly abandoned that plan as well. Convinced that Loring�s men were unfit for winter campaigning, Jackson decided to leave them here and march his beloved Stonewall Brigade back to Winchester, then perhaps lead it into action. ,  \tJackson and the brigade departed Romney on January 23 for Winchester. Loring began undermining Jackson�s reputation with the War Department, and on January 31, Jackson received a telegram from Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin outside military channels directing him to order Loring to leave Romney. Outraged at the breach of protocol and blatant interference, Jackson resigned but eventually was persuaded to remain in service."},{"id":159296,"title":"Confederate Memorial","pos":[39.34263,-78.76561],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=159296","desc":"Confederate Memorial. .

Unger's Crossroads Bivouacs. <i>(Preface):</i> On January 1, 1862, Confederate Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson led four brigades west from Winchester, Va., to secure Romney in the fertile South Branch Valley on the North Western Turnpike. He attacked and occupied Bath on January 4 and shelled Hancock, Md.; he marched into Romney on January 14. Despite atrocious winter weather, Jackson's men destroyed telegraph lines and 100 miles of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad track. Leaving Gen. William W. Loring's brigades in Romney, Jackson led the Stonewall Brigade back to Winchester on January 23. Loring followed on January 31, and the Federals reoccupied Romney on February 7., Along the stream behind you and on the bluffs in front of you, a Confederate army of 8,500 men twice bivouacked during the Bath-Romney Campaign, on January 2 and January 7-13, 1862. The first bivouac occurred as Confederate Gen. Thomas J. �Stonewall� Jackson�s men marched from Winchester to attack the Federal garrison at Bath (present day Berkeley Springs).,  \tAfter several days of fighting and tearing up Baltimore and Ohio Railroad track, Jackson�s army returned here on January 7 to rest before marching west to Romney. The weather deteriorated, inflicting hardship on both men and animals. The 8,500-man army bivouacked here for almost a week while the horses pulling the wagons and artillery were rough-shod for the icy roads.,  \tHundreds of wagons and horses, thousands of men, and relentless snow and rain quickly turned these fields into a quagmire that the soldiers sarcastically named Camp Mud. After three days, Jackson moved the camp half a mile to the northeast, and the men of the 33rd Virginia Infantry promptly named it Camp No Better. While his men lay in the mud exposed to the elements, Jackson enjoyed the hospitality and warmth of Oakleigh Manor (the large house on the hill in front of you), the home of Washington Unger, a local businessman and politician.,  \tDuring the campaign, some 2,000 men, or almost a quarter of Jackson�s force, became casualties not of bullets but illness. Many became sick during the miserable bivouac here and slowly staggered back to Winchester in small groups. An unknown number died of pneumonia and other diseases related to extreme exposure."},{"id":159430,"title":"Cameron's Depot Engagement","pos":[39.2906,-77.9086],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=159430","desc":"Cameron's Depot Engagement. \"What news now?\".  ,  <small>The Federal offensive in the Shenandoah Valley begun in May 1864 faltered in the summer with Confederate victories and Gen. Jubal A. Early's Washington Raid in July. Union Gen. Philip H. Sheridan took command in August, defeated Early at Winchester in September and Cedar Creek in October, burned mills and bars, and crushed the remnants of Early's force at Waynesboro on March 2, 1865. Sheridan's victories contributed to President Abraham Lincoln's reelection in November 1864 and denied Gen. Robert E. Lee's army much-needed provisions from the \"Breadbasket of the Confederacy.\", </small>  Union Gen. Philip H. Sheridan and Confederate Gen. Jubal A. Early jockeyed for position in the Shenandoah Valley for several weeks in July 1864. With Gen. Robert E. Lee reinforcing Early, Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ordered Sheridan to remain on the defensive and protect his army. Sheridan moved his army north from\tBerryville to prepared works at Halltown, a movement that convinced Early, erroneously, that Sheridan was �timid�. ,  On Sunday, August 21, 1864, as Sheridan marched to Halltown, Early attacked Sheridan�s mile-and-a half long position on the hills here with Gen Robert E. Rodes�s infantry division. The fight lasted from about 9 A.M. until dusk, and the hottest action took place here. In Washington at 3 P.M., an anxious Lincoln telegraphed an officer in Harpers Ferry \"What news now?\",  The fight here resulted in 260 Union casualties and 160 for the Confederates. The victories that Lincoln needed for reelection came first in September at Atlanta, Georgia, and then in the Valley, thanks to the �timid� Sheridan.,  This ruin is the northwestern corner of Locust Hill, the home of John B. and Lucy W. Packett. They and their slaves sheltered inside until Lt. Henry J. Nichols, 1st Vermont Heavy Artillery, led them to safety at Henry B. Davenport�s House.

Home of Lucy Washington Packette. When George Washington surveyed his brother Samuel�s Berkeley County land in preparation for the building of Harwood, the property included a sizable portion which has since been separated from the Harwood Estate. Dr. Samuel Washington, Colonel Samuel�s grandson, gave to his daughter Lucy Elizabeth a beautiful section of the home property. In 1840 after her marriage to John Bainbridge Packette, Lucy built a beautiful square mansion and named the property �Locust Hill�. The house was planned for hospitality and protection. The wide entrance door opens in the center to be flung open to welcome guests. The same door is fitted with an oak bar secured by strong iron slots on either side to discourage unwanted intruders. The entrance hall is spacious, with front rooms opening on either hand. Two large rooms at the rear of the hall can be thrown together by opening the nine-foot doors between them to form one immense drawing room or ballroom. During the 1870�s the basement kitchen was moved to its present location, and enclosed former porch extending the full length of the house. The second floor rooms mirror those of the main level. Locust Hill, facing east, commands a magnificent view of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Harper�s Ferry Gap, eleven miles away. An old stone smoke house and carriage house are still standing on the property. Locust Hill became a fort during the Civil War. General Philip Sheridan and his men took possession of the estate in the summer of 1864, placing the Packette family along with servants and guests in the basement under guard. The General used the house as his headquarters until August 21st, when General Jubal Early sent word that the house would be shelled and any civilians in residence should be removed at once. General Early waited at the back of the stone fence, which served as the west boundary line of Locust Hill, separating it from Sulgrave. Tired of waiting, General Early�s troops fired a cannon ball down the chimney and blew the stove to pieces as the family was leaving the kitchen under guard. Some of the Federal soldiers dressed themselves in clothes abandoned by the ladies and appeared at the windows, hoping that General Early and his men would think that the family was still in the main house. The scam was recognized and all were killed. After burying their dead on the estate, General Sheridan and his troops withdrew towards Harper�s Ferry. At the close of the War, the bodies were removed from Locust Hill and reburied in the National Cemetery at Winchester. Bullets and cannon balls damaged the rear wall of the house, and their marks remain there today. A long north porch, destroyed in the conflict, has recently been restored.

In 1940, it came to West Virginia as one of three coal-burning dinkies purchased by Winding Gulf Coal Company. They were used to haul coal from the mouth of a drift mine in Crab Orchard, across State Route 16 from behind what is now Webb's Florist, 7,000 feet downhill to the company's tipple on Piney Creek. Then the coal was loaded into Chesapeake and Ohio Railway coal cars and hauled to market. ,  The dinkies were retired ca. 1952 when Winding Gulf Coal switched to electric locomotives, which were more efficient because they could be loaded inside the mine and travel all the way to the Piney Creek tipple. Electric locomotives could also haul over 50 loads of coal, compared to a maximum of 20 for a dinky. ,  Winding Gulf Coal Company No.1 was given to the City in October 1962 and moved to the Raleigh County Vocation and Technical Center where it was repaired and repainted by students over the winter. Then, in June 1963, it was featured in Beckley's Centennial parade as the \"Fast Flying West Virginian.\" ,  The following week, the dinky was mounted near the swimming pool in New River Park, where it remained for 53 years.

It was to them simply the question of defending Virginia and Virginia's soil from the threatened invasion of a Northern army, and to preserve our rights and liberties as free people, and for which our ancestors had shed their blood in our contest with Great Britain. We were forced to the choice of which master to serve. We could not serve both. We regarded our primary allegiance due to the state which, with other states, had given life and existence to the federal agent that now, proposed to turn upon, crush, and destroy its creators. These were the arguments and presentations of the question of the time. For these contentions our people stood ready to surrender their lives, their all, save honor, and fought to the finish, only yielding to overwhelming and overpowering force. So faithfully and bravely battled, these principles are just as sacred to us today as they ever were, they were not lost by the results of the war, only the effort to maintain and establish them by arbitrament of the sword was a failure.\" ,  <i>-David F.

He resigned from the army in 1836 to take over as superintendent of the West Point foundry in Cold Spring, NY. Parrott became lessee and operator of the foundry, and experimented with the manufacture of artillery. In 1867, he turned foundry operations over to others but he experimented with projectiles and fuzes until his death in 1877.<p>  <small><b>(captions)</b> ,  The 10-pounder Parrott rifle (Model 1861, characterized by a muzzle swell) had a 2.9-inch bore, while the Model 1863 (no muzzle swell) had a 3-inch bore. The 10-pounder Parrott used shell, spherical case, and cannister. The 1863 version could fire ammunition for the Model 1861, but not vice-versa.<p>  Robert Parrott Parker (1804-1877, USMA Class of 1824) by Thomas P.

Making McClellan's Reputation. <i>(preface)</i> ,  In the spring of 1861, Union forces rushed into northwestern Virginia to secure the vital Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, protect important turnpikes, and support Unionists against Confederates. The two sides fought numerous engagements between June and December. They included Philippi (the war's first land battle), Rich Mountain, Corricks Ford, Cheat Summit Fort, Carnifex Ferry, and Camp Allegheny. The many Union victories made Gen. George B. McClellan's reputation and damaged that of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, a situation reversed in 1862. Despite later Confederate raids, today's West Virginia remained largely under Federal control for the rest of the war. <p> <i>(main text)</i> ,  In one of the first important Union victories of the Civil War, on July 11, 1861, Union Gen. George B. McClellan's forces defeated part of Confederate Gen. Robert S. Garnett's command here at the Hart Farm on Rich Mountain. Garnett was holding the area around Beverly, the junction of two important turnpikes: the Beverly and Fairmont and the Staunton and Parkersburg. Believing that the Rich Mountain defenses were virtually impregnable, Garnett had left a small force here under Lt. Col. John Pegram to hold this pass. Union Gen. William S. Rosecrans attacked uphill in a pouring rain and overran the Confederate position. That night, the Confederates abandoned Camp Garnett, their fortification at the western base of the mountain, and fled east through dark woods. Two days later, almost 600 of them surrendered to McClellan in Beverly. Others escaped south, guided by Stonewall Jackson's future mapmaker Jedediah Hotchkiss. <p> This small but important victory helped secure Union control of Virginia's western counties and contributed to the drive for West Virginia statehood, which was achieved in 1863.

It then meandered its way to the base of the Big Bend Mountain. From there, it followed the mountain until it reunited with the main river channel on the south side of the Big Bend Tunnel. <p> During construction and after completion of the Great Bend Tunnel there was little interference to the flow of this arm. Then, when the Big Bend Tunnel was being built, railroad planners decided to close off this arm by utilizing the fill from the new tunnel. This decision saved them the expense of building two additional trestles and had provided a convenient site for disposing the excess fill that was excavated from the tunnel. <p> After the north arm of the river was blocked, the river still flows under the fill and surfaces West of and below this site creating a wetland. You can still see stands of original native species located in the original waterway. One of the most predominate species is Lizard Tails (Saururus Cernuus). The entire area was devoid of trees during tunnel construction. Now eighty plus years later, a mature stand of native lowland tree species encompasses the area. <p> <b>GB Cabin Talcott Telegraph Office</b> ,  With trains traveling in both directions on a single track in certain locations, communications became vital to avoid the collision of trains traveling in opposite directions. To address this situation, the C&O Railway, along with other railroads, established telegraph offices called cabins that were identified with alphabetical call signs. They were located at each end of the single track and other locations depending upon the need. <p> When double tracks were extended from Lowell to Talcott the GN Cabin Lowell was relocated to this spot on 12 May 1902 and renamed to GB Cabin Talcott. In preparation to putting in an interlocking system manufactured by the National Switch and Signal Company of Easton, Pennsylvania. This system allowed trains to traverse the single track between the GB Cabin Talcott and MW Cabin Hilldale and vice versa making collision close to an impossibility. The system is complex to explain but the actual operation was not difficult. Double tracks were established in 1932 upon the completion of the Big Bend Tunnel.

First published in the Washington Post in 1969.</blockquote></small> ,   This is the site where the Legend of John Henry was born. A steel driver in the employment of Captain William R. Johnson, he was employed to help bore the Great Bend Tunnel through Big Bend Mountain for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. When a steam drill showed up at the site, a threat to the workers livelihood became evident. John Henry challenged it to a contest and the rest is history, Most accounts agree that after about an hour he had out driven the steam drill by more than five feet. He then \"laid down his hammer and died&#8221; is a point of contention. However, John Henry did work in the Great Bend Tunnel and this has been substantiated by historians. <p> It is a common misconception that the story of John Henry is a tall tale for children like those about his fellow American folk heroes Paul Bunyan, Mighty Casey, and Pecos Bill, In some stories he is mistakenly thought to be a \"railroad man&#8221; and portrayed as a gandy dancer driving spikes into rail ties. <p> The residents of Talcott and the surrounding area will disagree with this assumption for they know the true account of the legend. So do the descendants of the men who made up the construction gangs that built railroads and worked on other major construction projects. These were the men who made up work songs about John Henry's exploits and chanted them in time to the blows of their hammers and picks. <p> The many versions of the work songs that are sung show the appeal his story has had for working men and women over the years. John Henry has become a symbol of man's determination to overcome natural and man-made obstacles placed in his path and increasing advancements in technology. <p> The story of John Henry the man was developed from the accounts of the men who worked alongside him at the tunnel. Dr. Louis W. Chappell, an associate professor of English at West Virginia University, and Dr. Guy B. Johnson of the University of North Carolina Institute for Research in Social Science, conducted extensive interviews during the mid to late 1920's with many men that had knowledge of the affair. In 1928, Dr. Johnson published John Henry Tracking Down a Negro Legend. In 1933, Dr. Chappell published John Henry a Folklore Study. <p> The men they interviewed provided testimonies that were at times contradictory. Considering that 50 years had gone by since the contest had taken place, this inconsistency could have been due to the fact that most of interviewees related events that had been passed down to them though the preceding generations or from stories and songs. However, when the information was assimilated the results found that it supported an actual event. Another reason could be that after the Civil War it was not uncommon for newly freed men to take on the name John Henry. Therefore, it is probable that more than one John Henry worked on the tunnel. Unfortunately, a fire at the C&0'S offices destroyed all of the pertinent contractor's records and reports. <p> John Henry was an African American possibly newly freed from enslavement from either Virginia or North Carolina. He was between 30 and 35 years old when he came to the tunnel in 1870. He stood about six feet tall and weighed around 200 pounds with muscles tempered from a life of hard work. He had a friendly demeanor and was a popular man at the site. He was also the steel driving champion of the camp (possibly having beaten a fellow steel driver by the named of Olery or 0'Leary for that title). His proficiency as a steel driver along with his physical endurance earned him the respect of the entire camp. Some of the ballads place a women coming to him during the night without fear of being molested due to his reputation. Other accounts state that he had a wife by the name of Pollie Ann. This supports the local belief that Pollie Ann is buried in the Simpson Methodist Church Cemetery (the cemetery is all that remains) near Pie Hollow. <p> John Henry was in charge of his work gang where he set the pace singing in time with his blows. One man who had been a water boy on his shift remembered him as \"the singin' est man I ever saw.&#8221; John Henry would not even break rhythm to call for water but would chant in a booming voice without missing a stroke; <p> <i>Ain't I getting' dry, hunh ,  A swinging this hammah, hunh</i> <p> Songs were sung to help the workers maintain an even workable pace throughout the day. The songs also served to keep their minds off of the dangerous dreary conditions that they labored under. Most of the songs were lively tunes about fellow workers, loose women, bosses, and heroes like John Henry or anything else that caught their fancy. The setting of the story of his celebrated contest with the steam drill was acted out in a wild and colorful setting one befitting a great legend. An observer during that period described the Countryside around Big Bend Mountain as \"a howling wilderness\". <p> Workers, whose job it was to drill the horizontal holes into the heading of the tunnel and into the unlined roof on occasions, were constantly in danger of rock falls. John Henry excelled in this environment. He and his fellow steel drivers performed their work by their will and strength drilling holes in the rock for black powder charges or an explosive called Dualin. As many as 50 holes, sometimes up to 14 feet deep, were required for each shot. When the rock was blown free, it was mucked out by hand and hauled away in mule drawn carts. <p> It is often said that John Henry used two hammers (it is the general consensus that the hammers were smaller than standard size) and was the only driver who could manage this feat. Swinging one after another in each hand, few shakers could keep up with such a pace. Phil Henderson or Little Bill as some of the ballads refer to him was John Henry's trusted shaker. This trust worked both ways as one stanza of several ballads purport. <p> <i>John Henry told his shaker, ,  \"Shaker, you bette' pray ,  For if I miss this six-foot steel ,  Tomorrow 'll be your burial day, Lawd Lawd! ,  Tomorrow 'll be your burial day\"</i> <p> The steam power drill had been invented and was in use on the nearby Lewis Tunnel also built by the C&0 during the same period. It is reported that at least one model of the steam drill was tried at the Great Bend Tunnel. That John Henry challenged and beat the steam drill is attested by many first hand reports. All of the witnesses agree that the contest took place at the mouth of the east portal. This is also supported by men who years later came to arch the tunnel. They saw the drill holes in the east portal before they covered them with brick. <p> The contest probably lasted about an hour as accounts vary from 35 minutes to two hours. The machine that John Henry battled was probably the Burleigh stream drill. The machine, in continuance use, was being promoted to reduce labor cost by two thirds. It did have two flaws-a tendency to hang up in cracks and to clog up with rock dust. It had worked sufficiently in the sandstone of Lewis Tunnel but was insufficient in the red shale of Big Bend Mountain. This apparent weakness probably contributed to this line in many versions of the ballad. <p> \"Your hole's done choke and your drill's done broke\" <p> That John Henry drove 14 feet of steel to the steam drills nine was the general consensus. Due to the consistency of the red shale, the steam drill was determined to be impracticable and unreliable for the task. Some of the descriptions given to Dr. Chappell by men who claimed to have been present confirm the drills flaw. John Hendrick, a tunnel supervisor at the time of the contest reported; <p> \"(John Henry) drove steel with a steam drill at the east side, on the inside of the tunnel not far from the end. He was working under Foreman Steele, and he beat the steam drill too. The steam drill got hung up, but John Henry was beaten it all the time.\" <p> Neal Miller, who had carried water and steel for the workmen said, \"Phil Henderson turned the steel for John Henry when he drove in the contest with the steam drill at the east end of the tunnel. John Henry beat the drill because it got hung in the seam of the rock and lost time.\" <p> Most of the eyewitness and written accounts show the contest occurring toward the start of the project in early 1870. Testimony from the men confirm that no drilling machine was ever used in the actual digging of the tunnel. The drill was apparently taken apart and the parts used on various equipment after it proved insufficient for the task. <p> Very few of the men who had been at the tunnel believed that John Henry died of overexertion after the contest. Many who came to the tunnel months after the contest remember seeing him. A tribute to their honesty is that most of these admit they only heard about John Henry and the steam drill. Some of the tunnel men told Dr. Chappell that they thought John Henry died in a rock slide inside of the tunnel or he had died of fever toward the end of the project. One thought he survived the tunnel and drifted off to follow his trade elsewhere. One man was adamant that he saw his body carried out after a premature blast. <p> It is probable that his body ended up in the fill near the east portal. More than one version of the ballad has him being buried in the sand. This is substantiated by two Meadows brothers that worked at hewing out the timbers and cross ties for the tunnel. They purport that he was buried approximately 1,000 feet from the east portal about 12 feet from the main C&0' S right away in the sand. This is entirely possible as the North Arm of the Greenbrier River flowed along the base of the right of way during that period. <p> The story of American folk hero John Henry is still evolving though song, word of mouth, print and the internet. Many modem day artist, actors and singers have taken an interest in the story adding their own twist to the legend. It is irrelevant if the story of John Henry it true or a legend. The real truth is of a man who stood up for his convictions against technological advancement that would have (and eventually did to this day) reduce the amount of workers required to perform jobs in all fields. <p> The man and his feat is an inspiration to workers worldwide-to those that are diligent to become the best while considering the well being of their fellow workers. These are the people that share the traits and convictions of John Henry."},{"id":165177,"title":"Great Bend Tunnel Construction","pos":[37.64956,-80.76663],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=165177","desc":"Great Bend Tunnel Construction. .  ,  <b>Great Bend Tunnel Construction</b>  ,  Construction of the Great Bend Tunnel aka the Big Bend Tunnel began on 10 January 1870, tracks were laid 9 September - 12 September, 1872, and final completion of the tunnel was in early 1873. The C&O Railroad resident engineer was Capt. Richard H. Talcott. ,  The primary contractor was Capt. William R. Johnson who was educated as a civil engineer and served in that capacity in a Confederate regiment during the Civil War. He employed 800- 1,000 workers at various trades. Most of the workers were either African-Americans newly freed from enslavement, Irish immigrants, and other nationalities. Once completed, the tunnel was 6,450- feet in length with a slight curve at the east end due to an engineering error. ,  The work began at the west end of the tunnel. The first thirteen months of construction was done in Monroe County, West Virginia as Summers County was not created until 27 February, 1871. The tunnel was built by the determination of men and boys using man and mule power. Construction began with three shafts drilled to the tunnel's floor. The shafts were used for three purposes: to carry out rocks and dirt as work progressed, to enable the crews to work on different headings, and to allow much need fresh air into the tunnel. There was a total of six working headings including the portals. There were other crews that cleared and graded the approach to each portal. ,  African-American captains and crews often manned the flat bottom boats called bateaux that were used to float the equipment and supplies used to build the tunnel down the Greenbrier River. At the time, there was a limited amount of steam power in use with only two 30-horsepower engines being used to power the hoists in the shafts. These engines were delivered in this manner. ,  Men used hammers designed for the task of driving long drill bits into the rock for the explosives to be placed to blast the red shale and solid flint rock day in and day out. Dualin, a new volatile explosive mix of nitroglycerin and sawdust or wood pulp, was used. On 10:00 a.m. on 31 July 1872 the heading between shaft one and two were driven together allowing fresh air to traverse the entire tunnel. ,  After this all work was suspended and all parties repaired to headquarters where a barrel of whiskey was rolled out for all to partake. Fortunately, there were few knives, pistols, or fists flourished with no causalities reported. Upon completion, the interior of the tunnel was lined with timbers rather than brick. This oversight and inadequate ventilation proved to be costly to lives and equipment. Both of these mistakes were addressed in later years. ,  Working in these conditions brought sickness, death, and the ever present possibility of being maimed for life. The three primary dangers were silicosis, accidental explosions, and rock falls. One documented fall was estimated at 8,000 cubic yards. Quite a few of the workers had an abject fear of working where someone had just died. It was in the contractor's best interest to downplay these deaths and accidents as much as possible. Rumor has it that mass graves are located on each end of the tunnel and at the fill before the old trestle where it crosses Hungards Creek \"where they buried men and mules.\" ,  Other dangers abounded in the workers' camp lives as with all places where men and boys were assembled in large numbers living in close proximity to one another. They lived in wooden shanties built along the C&O's right of way. Money, while not abundant to the workers, was enough for them to afford their share of whiskey which some of them partook in at every opportunity that presented itself. The combination of strong men and whiskey normally resulted in fist fights, stabbings, and shootings. Bear in mind this was a recurring issue every payday. Another danger was dishonest individuals willing to separate the honest workers money from them using any means available. It was not uncommon for workers that had just got paid to be found dead either in the woods or floating in the river. ,  Due to inadequate information during the bidding process, Captain Johnson and his partners ended up going broke. His partners took advantage of the bankruptcy law and he was advised to do likewise. He refuse to file and later when he was a Successful coal operator he repaid all of his creditor's principal and interest. In appreciation of his honor, his creditors presented him with a silver bowl bearing the inscription \"an honest man is the noblest work of God.\" ,  <b>Ross Merle Dillard Alphonso Evans: ,  The Man Behind the Statue</b> ,  Ross Evans (22 December 1898 - 28 December 1985) was the youngest son of Calvin and Ada Virginia Cave Tyler Evans. He was born at Talcott, West Virginia near the Great Bend Tunnel where he lived his entire life. Ross and his wife Berta reared eight children. All of his children received a college education and went on to become responsible, respected citizens. ,  His grandmother Mariah was part Indian (tribe unknown). She worked as a maid and companion to Dr. James P. Rogers on his plantation at Earlysville, Virginia. ,  His father Calvin Evans was born into slavery 3 September 1852. In 1869, at the age of 17, Calvin left home for West Virginia. He worked several railroad jobs until he was semi-disabled due to a railroad- related accident. On 4 July 1876, he married Ada Tyler at Ruckersville, Virginia. They eventually settled in Talcott where they purchased a house near the Great Bend Tunnel. After his injury, he and Ada opened the first restaurant in Talcott. To paraphrase a quote from Ross, during the hard times of World War I, his father gave away more meals than he sold thus causing the restaurant to close sometime in 1917. Calvin was a man of strong character whom people of all colors knew, trusted, and respected to the extent that they allowed their children to stay all summer with him and his family. ,  His mother Ada Tyler Evans was born into slavery 9 August 1858 on a plantation near Ruckersville, Virginia. Her father was a white man. Unfortunately, his name is not known. After her birth, her mother Nellie married Wash Tyler. Ada was a woman of strength and conviction. She cared for eight children, livestock, a garden, and the house while Calvin was away at work all week. She was a devoted Baptist and taught Sunday school for 30 years. She organized the committee to construct the Second Baptist Church at Talcott and raised the most money for that purpose. She was honored by a plaque hanging to this day on the wall of the church. She was called the Mother of the Church. ,  Ross was a favorite child from birth and he received attention from everyone. His early life was full of outdoor activities including hunting, fishing, or just roaming the surrounding mountains. He started work at an early age and worked a lot of different jobs during that time. When he was fourteen, his father arranged for him to be a camp cook for a deer hunting party on Bald Mountain. This side occupation would continue for most of his working days. He began his railroad career in 1917 as a cook and ended his career 46 years later as a passenger train porter for the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O). He met Berta Mae Barnett during the summer of 1920 and married her the following year on 7 September 1921 at her family farm at Springwood, Virginia. Berta shared his love of the outdoors and they both spent as much time as possible together in that pursuit. Berta was a midwife in the community helping women deliver children of all colors. At the 1973 C&O annual shareholders meeting, Ross and Berta were guests of honor at the White Sulphur Springs Hotel along with three other employees and their wives representing some 35,000 Chessie system employees for outstanding service to fellow workers and their communities. ,  Ross, a charter member and Finance Chairman of the Hilldale-Talcott Ruritan Club, spearheaded the fund drive for the John Henry statue and the overlook park above the tunnel. Singer Johnny Cash was one of the first that donated to the project along with then Secretary of State and future West Virginia Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, local bankers, businessmen, school children, and many other donations from the people of all walks of life. The likeness of this statue is of Ross-a hardworking, dedicated, determined, and trustworthy man. <blockquote>I met Ross in the summer of 1920 when I went to Talcott to visit my sister, Icie. Ross came down to my home in Springwood, Virginia, to visit me. He also came down to the little town in Virginia where I was teaching. I was so proud of Ross because he dressed so much style. He even carried an umbrella. He made a great impression on the people there.</blockquote>, Berta Barnett Evans, wife of Ross Evans <blockquote>When I was a youngster, I had the privilege of working for Ross Evans. I hoed corn, cleaned out weeds, helped him catching chubs (minnows) out of Howard's Creek below the White Sulphur Hotel in White Sulphur Springs and helped him set trot lines in the Greenbrier River. Ross was an excellent fisherman and caught many large catfish from the trot lines he baited with Howard's Creek chubs. ,  At this time, most people thought nothing of exploiting a youngster's labor Whether it was in the form of underpayment or no payment. Ross was an exception. He not only paid a fair wage and never tried to take advantage of you but he also cooked you lunch. Until this day, I can still smell and taste the delicious hamburger that he fixed. ,  One early afternoon, I met him while he was checking his chubs that he kept in Hungards Creek below his home. I inquired if he was needing any help that week. He told me that he was going out of town on a trip paid for by the railroad to model for the John Henry statue. ,  This has been a long time ago and the original conversation we had is faded. But, to my knowledge, Ross explicitly told me he was the model of John Henry.</blockquote>, Michael E. Cales ,  <b>Hilldale-Talcott Ruritan Club</b>  ,  The Ruritans are an organization dedicated to community service in rural areas. The Hilldale-Talcott Ruritan Club was formed in 1968 with the express purposes of establishing the John Henry Historical Park and to promote and foster community development in Hilldale, Talcott, and Summers County. ,  The Ruritans, many of whom were retired C&O Railway employees, local businessmen, and area citizens, coordinated with local historical groups, schoolchildren, media outlets, West Virginia political officials, and national celebrities to collect hundreds of small donations for the commissioning of the John Henry statue and the establishment of the original roadside park on the mountain above the Great Bend Tunnel. ,  The park was opened in 1972 on the one- hundredth anniversary of the opening of the tunnel and the birth of the John Henry legend. The opening ceremony included the grand entrance of the John Henry statue through the Great Bend Tunnel on a special train.  , "},{"id":165180,"title":"John Henry In Fiction","pos":[37.64958,-80.76665],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=165180","desc":"John Henry In Fiction. .  , <b>This educational kiosk provides examples of the fictional John Henry as depicted by the entertainment industry. Some are animated and some non-animated. While entertaining, they do not represent the legend. The following are summaries of some of the most prominent productions.</b> <p> <b>The Story of John Henry</b> is part of the animated Rabbit Ears Series published in 1995 with narration by Denzel Washington and music by B.B. King. It begins with Denzel Washington proclaiming that it is a 99.9% gold-plated true story. In this production, John Henry is born weighing 45 pounds with a hammer in his hand, talking, and asking for a large amount of food and 2 pots of strong coffee 2 hours later. When he becomes so large that he is unable to fit in the front door of his parents' home, he sets out on his own and follows a railroad track until he reaches the Big Bend Mountain. There, he hires on with the C&O Railroad or C&O Line. His job is portrayed as a \"gandy dancer&#8221; driving railroad spikes into wooden ties to hold the tracks in place instead of as a tunneling steel driver. The steam drill is described as a complicated machine made of six types of steel with dials, gauges, drills, and hammers everywhere. The production has John Henry and the steam drill entering the tunnel together. After the contest is over, it is announced that John Henry had defeated the machine. He then emerges from the tunnel covered in coal dust and dies shortly after the narrator then tells us that he is just resting. <p> <b>John Henry and the Railroad</b> is a non-animated True Tall Tale production by Whitestone Motion Pictures in 2014. It stars E. Roger Mitchell as John Henry and Eugene H. Russel IV as Jack Henry, his son. Russell was also the narrator and Nicholas Kirk provided the music. <p> This version begins with the narrator proclaiming that everything he tells you is the honest to goodness truth. John Henry is a 5' 6&#8221; newly freed slave looking for a better life for himself and his son. He drives three spikes with three swings of his hammer to win a job as the result of a bet with the railroad boss. This version also has him working for the O&H Railroad and never refers to Big Bend Mountain nor West Virginia. <p> According to the story, if the railroad is completed on time, all of the workers will receive 40 acres of land for their pay. When they are close to completing the job, a spike-driving machine shows up and the boss tells them that they are being replaced by a giant tin can. John Henry challenges the machines operator to a 3-mile contest to save the men's jobs and their future land. The story has him driving railroad spikes though flat land until he comes to a big mountain when the machine, which is equipped with a drill, starts to go through it. John Henry tells his son to bring out his biggest hammers. When the crew questions him about the bigger hammers, he replies \"there are always bigger hammers\". Once he has them he uses them to bore a tunnel though the mountain without any other help to win the contest. He does not die in this version but goes on to farm his 40 acres where he outlives that \"rusty piece of junk\". \"Grit, sweat, and love&#8221; is his motto. <p> Shelly Duvall's non-animated Tall Tales and Legends-John Henry (1986) was written by Sarah Wenk. The cast includes Danny Glover, Tom Hulce, Lou Rawls, Lynn Whitfield, Barry Corbin, and Shelly Duvall. Tom Hulce begins the tale by stating that John Henry was as big as a mountain, had arms as big as oak trees, could pick a field of cotton in a day and had a voice like the angels themselves. <p> On the night he was born, lightning bolts shaped like 9-pound steel fill the sky and thunder that sounded like laughter filled the nighttime. By the time he was 12 years old he could split rails like a grown man and won rail splitting contest every Sunday. In 1867 the slaves in Tennessee were set free with no work available. John Henry set out for West Virginia and walked all the way to the C&O work camp at Big Bend Mountain. Upon arrival he meets Polly Ann and immediately is smitten and is spurned in return. When the boss (Jenkins) refuses to hire him, he challenges the top steel driver Spike, who is Polly Ann's boyfriend, to a contest-him using 1 hand, Spike using 2 hands for a job. He wins the contest then tells Spike that the mountain is big enough for 2 champions and that he is \"nothing but a natural born man nothing more nothing less\". In spite of this, Spike leaves the camp. John Henry continues to try to impress Polly Ann and does not secede until he feigns sickness that backfires on him until he presents her with flowers he had pick for her. After a short courtship he proposes to her and she accepts they become man and wife. <p> The work performed in this production has John Henry driving both railroad spikes to hold down the tracks and driving steel drill bits into the mountain for placing explosives. When Jenkins decides to bring in the steam drill (the Ol' Mighty Steam Drill), he does so with the anticipation of it doing the work of 10 men; therefore, cutting cost and saving time by replacing the men. John Henry tells him that it can't drive more steel then him and suggest that they have a 10- hour contest. If he wins, the men keep their jobs. Jenkins agrees to the terms then later offers him $50.00 and a permanent job to back out of the contest. John Henry refuses to abandon his co-workers and their family's livelihood. When Spikes hears of the contest he returns and offers to be John Henry's shaker saying before he was a champion steel driver he was a champion shaker. When John Henry wins the contest by driving 15 feet to the steam engine's nine. Jenkins proclaims, \"No mortal man could do what you had done\". Tom Hulce concludes saying that John Henry's laughter blew a \"hole in the mountain and it is now called the Big Bend Tunnel, that he had worn out 50 hammers, and he hit the mountain so hard it cried creating a beautiful waterfall.&#8221; On the question of if he died, the narrator states that you can't kill off a man like John Henry. <p> <b>Greatest American Tall Tales and Legends</b> produced be Schlessinger Media (2006) is an animated production. Cast and voices include Thomas H. Zingarelli (Curly Joe) narrator, Robyn Ferralane, John Barilla, Rusty Ferralane, Denis Rowland, and Brice F. Miller. The production begins with the narrator Curly Joe telling of John Henry's birth in West Virginia. Right from the start, you knew the birth to be rare for a rainbow appeared over the broken down cabin his parents owned. \"Now a rainbow in itself is rare but John Henry was rare himself\". He was a large child that barely fitted in the cradle. He surprises everyone by reaching out and taking his father's hammer, which weighs 30 pounds or more. <p> After the Civil War was over, money could be made clearing rocks for roadways. A road boss hires John Henry after he breaks to pieces a large rock with one swing of his hammer. He also fires the rest of the crew until John Henry points out that they will be needed to remove the debris. The boss relents with the exception of Willie who is small in stature. But, John Henry insists that Willie is an important part of the job and prevails. This is the beginning of John Henry's desire to look out for his friends and coworkers. Then narrator Curly Joe informs us that he was the biggest strongest man in the state of West Virginia and that he married a girl by the name of Pollie and had a son. <p> When the railroad arrives, he inquiries about a job and the captain is ready to hire him. But everyone is afraid to hold the spike for him. Therefore, the captain refuses to hire an untested man. His old friend Willie appears and agrees to hold the spike which John Henry drives in one swing. Thus, securing a job for Willie and himself. Curly Joe tells us that when he worked at night sparks flew up from his hammer giving the appearance of fireworks for miles around. John Henry liked to sing a song \"a man is nothing but a man, and a man has to do his best but every man sometimes no matter how strong got to take his rest\". <p> When a new newfangled machine called a steam drill arrives threatening to take the jobs of the men, he challenges it to a contest-whoever goes the furthest into the mountain wins. John Henry wins after the machine blows up, but he is unable to stop working until he breaks out of the other side of the mountain. The strain was too much for his heart and he falls down telling Willie that he's done the best he could do and it is now time for him to take his rest. Curly Joe ends the story be informing us that if we are ever in West Virginia to be sure to visit the Big Bend Tunnel. <p> Disney's animated version <b>John Henry American Legend</b> released in 2002 features Geoffrey Jones as the voice of John Henry, Alfre Woodard's voice as Polly, Tim Hodge's voice as MacTavish, Dave Murry's voice as Thomas, Carrie Harrington's voice as the singing voice of Polly, and music by Stephen James Taylor with the introduction and conclusion by James Earl Jones. This short version has singing and music interlaced with the story and John Henry and Polly as newlywed, newly freed slaves that are looking for a better life. <p> They come upon the railroad camp where the workers have all but given up. John Henry rejuvenates the men and the work continues. Their pay in this version is 50 acres of land upon completion. Like \"John Henry and the Railroad\", when the steam drill arrives on site, the contract is terminated voiding the 50 acres promised to the men. John Henry challenges the steam drill to a contest at the mountain first and temporary thinks that he had won. Then, the machine arrives and to everyone's surprise, there is a drill attached to it and it is immediately put to use drilling though the mountain. At first, John Henry losses faith in himself and gives up until Polly sings an encouraging song to him and another worker gives him a second hammer. This energies John Henry and he hammers his way through the mountain to win the contest. He then falls down and dies in Polly's arms with his hammer in his hand. James Earl Jones concludes the story with, \"In Talcott, West Virginia, a statue of John Henry now towers over the Great Bend Tunnel as a powerful reminder that the American spirit is �s indomitable today as it was yesterday\". <p> These fictional versions, while entertaining to the young and old alike, are what they are-works of fiction. No more, no less. Here are some of the differences seen in the summaries above. <p> . All of the versions portrays John Henry with super natural strength. ,  . All of them misrepresents the type of work in which he was employed. Rather than driving spikes into wooden ties to hold the track down, he was a steel driver-a man that hammered steel drill bits into the rock to make holes for explosives. ,  . The shakers job description: a shaker's job was to hold the steel, then, shake and slightly turn the bit every time the hammer hit it. Not holding railroad spikes. ,  . Working for the C&O Railroad or O&H Railroad: the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) is the proper name. ,  . They were to receive 40 or 50 acres of land: John Henry works for daily wages for one of the sub-contractors that built the tunnel. ,  . The railroad track was already at the mountain: the railroad tracks were miles away and did not reach the site until the tunnel was almost completed. , "},{"id":165182,"title":"John Henry","pos":[37.64956,-80.76676],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=165182","desc":"John Henry. .  ,  This statue was erected in 1972, by a group of people with the same determination as the one it honors.

Unfortunately, over the years during different projects, many of them were destroyed, moved or buried. The best preserved are at the east end of the old trestle near the Woodson House site. They are located on the old railway bed leading to where the old trestle crossed Hungards Creek. There was a railway crossing as well in this area that served the high water road (the main road went under the trestle) then in use during flooding of the river and or creek. The old road is south and east of the old railroad bed and is currently part of the park's trail system. During the construction of the parking area, several foundations where exposed. The best preserved one now rests beside the Woodson House sign. <p> On the west side of the trestle, a few of them are preserved in their proper place and some have been moved or pushed over the embankment. The last site and the most disturbing is here at the tunnel where one concrete (that is not in its proper place) and the only cut stone foundation is all that is evident of the many that must have been here during the 100 years plus use of the now abandon track. Upon close inspection of the mountain in the forefront, one can discern that is was indented to accommodate the cut stone signal foundation. This cut stone foundation dates back to when automatic signals first came into use on the C&O Railway. <p> The first of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railways signals were the manually operated lower quadrant semaphores installed at telegraph cabins or train depots until late in the 1800s and early 1900s when the automatic 3-position, upper-quadrant semaphore signal became the industry's standard. After the advent of the incandescent light bulb in 1914, Color Light Signals came into use and are now the primary signals of the then C&O Railway and now CSX Transportation. In 1928, the first 3-position light signal bridge was installed between Talcott and Hilldale-one on each end of the tunnel. This signal bridge would have been attached to the cut stone foundation in the foreground. It is probable that this cut stone foundation were used for the single mast upper quadrant semaphore, single mast color light signal, and the three position light cantilever bridge. <p> It should be noted that not all of the concrete foundations throughout the park were used to support signals. Other  foundations were used for the trestle abutments, railroad crossing, switches, and supports for necessary equipment."},{"id":165184,"title":"Hungards Creek Trestle","pos":[37.65206,-80.76301],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=165184","desc":"Hungards Creek Trestle. .  ,  There has been at least two railroad trestles crossing Hungards Creek. The one pictured is in the process of being dismantled in preparation for one that will accommodate a double track from Lowell to the east end of the Great Bend Tunnel. If it was the first trestle it would have been built after the railroad bed was completed allowing trains to deliver the steel and other necessary materials. During that time frame there was no overland transportation and the steel being too heavy for the Bateaux Boats to transport it via the river.  <p> Providing that it was the second one the first one would been built from wood using local timber. Wood being in abundant supply and easily accessible it was used to construct many of the trestles large and small. Considering the short time frame 1872-1887 if a wood trestle was in place it was probably used as a temporary means of crossing the creek. <p> As one can see most of the cut stones used for piers on the west side of the creek have been removed. The majority of these were used when they built the new railroad bridge across the Greenbrier River in Lowell.

The story of the southern West Virginia \"smokeless&#8221; coalfields is a remarkable legacy of working-class culture, industrial might, racial and ethnic diversity, and the creation of a unique and distinctive culture of national significance. <p> The coal mines along the Coal Heritage Trail produced the abundant and economical fuel which transformed rural America into an industrial power, provided jobs and homes for thousands of people fleeing persecution and oppression, made immense fortunes for those who invested in the industry, and produced a storied society with o peculiar and fascinating legacy. <p> <b>Why The Tunnel Was Built</b>  ,  Often, in mountainous terrain, a railroad is built along the relatively flat ground adjacent to a river. Just as the saying goes that \"time is money\", it is also said in the transportation industry that \"miles are money\". As this graphic shows, the Great Bend Tunnel, illustrated by the red line, is over one-mile in length. However, it is approximately 10-miles following a Greenbrier River-oriented route around the Big Bend Mountain. Thus, construction of the tunnel was of great economic benefit to the railroad as it eliminated approximately nine miles of haulage for rail cargo going either east or west. Similarly, traveling straight through the tunnel saved considerable time as trains did not have to slow down to navigate all the sharp turns that would be required traveling around a river route. <p> <b>The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Comes to Town</b>  ,  When the contractor's work crews arrived to begin construction of the Great Bend Tunnel for the C&O, there was a small settlement on the east side of the Greenbrier River named Rollinsburg. Named after prominent landowner Charles Rollyson, the settlement consisted of a post office, general store, blacksmith shop, the Rollynsburg Baptist Church, and approximately eight residential dwellings. <p> The post office remained in Rollinsburg up to 1882. Up to this time, the west side of the river was named by the C&O as Talcott Station. After completion of the Talcott Post Office in 1882, Rollinsburg became part of Talcott and the town was officially born. The onginal settlers resisted this change and, to this day, there are descendants that still refer to that part of Talcott as Rollinsburg. <p> The west side of the river (that would be Talcott proper) was primarily farmland with a grist mill in operation on Hungards Creek owned by Zachariah Augustus Woodson. Woodson, Griffith Meadows, and the heirs of Wilson Lively were the major landowners. <p> The area surrounding the community was based ona subsistence economy. Livestock was driven on foot to eastern markets and other products were exported and imported by wagon. With the completion of the train depot named after Captain Talcott, the C&O's resident engineer for the Great Bend Tunnel, previously unavailable markets became accessible to farmers and merchants. With the increased demand for goods and services, people began in earnest to build a town with all the amenities of that day. <p> Today, the town is a shell of the once prosperous trading center that it once was. The rail depot is gone along with the hotels, stores, barber shops, shoe stores, beer joints, blacksmith shops, and the gas stations that came along later."},{"id":165204,"title":"Simpson Methodist Church Cemetery","pos":[37.65165,-80.75476],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=165204","desc":"Simpson Methodist Church Cemetery.

They included Philippi (the war's first land battle), Rich Mountain, Corricks Ford, Cheat Summit Fort, Carnifex Ferry, and Camp Allegheny. The many Union victories made Gen. George B.

Some fighting occurred on Main Street as Porterfield and his men fled in such haste that the battle was referred to as the Philippi Races. Only a few men on either side were wounded, and none were killed. Kelley was struck in the chest; he later named his horse Philippi. Ahead of you on Main Street, Confederate Pvt. James E.

Lt.-Colonel Adam Stephen ,  Captain Thomas Cocke ,  Captain Henry Woodward ,  Captain Robert McKenzie ,  Captain Christopher Gist,   Captain George Mercer ,  Captain William Bronaugh ,  Captain David Bell ,  Captain Henry Harrison.,   The President having informed the council that the General Assembly had resolved upon building a chain of Forts for the protection of the Frontiers, To begin at Henry Enocks's, on Great Capecapon, and extend in the most convenient line to May-river the building of which forts was not to exceed two thousand pounds, and as the fixing upon the places judiciously was a matter of great importance to the country, He desired their advice thereupon; and put the following Questions,   <i>First: Whether it was advisable to begin the said chain of forts at Henry Enocks's on Great Cacapon?, </i>  The Council was unanimous in opinion that it was not, Because, as the Province of Maryland had abandoned their Settlements on Potowmack to a great distance it left a fertile and populous district, from that down to Maidstone, at Watkins' Ferry, exposed to incursions of the Enemy; and to which there lead several warrior paths from Raystown and Susquehannah, much frequented by the Indians.,   <i>Secondly: Which was the most convenient and central place to build on, for the protection of that District? , </i> ,   The council was of opinion that at, or near Bendicks plantation above the mouth of Sleepy Creek, was the most convenient and central place to build a fort on for the defence of the Inhabitants on Sleepy-Creek and Back-Creek, the lower parts of Opecon and Shanandoah river.,   <i>Thirdly: Where ought the second Fort to be built? , </i> ,   The Council having considered the situation of the country and the Body of Inhabitants to be defended are of opinion, that at or near to Henry Enocks's plantation or Great Cacapon, is the most advisable place to build the second fort on.,   It defends the inhabitants on the waters of Capecapon, is contiguous to the Settlements on the heads of the waters of sleepy and back-creeks: and maintains the communication with the Forts on Patterson's creek, &c.,   <i>Fourthly: Are the Forts on Pattersons creek to be esteemed in the Line intended by the Assembly?</i>,   The Forts on Patterson's Creek being already built, and provided with several necessary houses, and the Country having more hard Service in view, than the small number of their forces can perform, and considering likewise that to abandon those Forts, and give up so much to the Enemy would increase their insolence, and give them a disadvantageous opinion of our strength, The council are of opinion that these forts are to be maintained, and reckoned in the chain intended by the Assembly.,   <i>Fifthly: Is it then necessary to have a fort between that and Enocks and Ashby's?</i>,   To open a communication between the forts at Enocks's and Ashby's, it is necessary to clear a road leading to the South-Branch above Suttons plantation, passing near to Ross's mill, from the best and nearest way to the fort commanded by Captain John Ashby; and as the distance will not be above twenty-two miles, it is not necessary to build between. But the Council are of the opinion that a Block-House may be found necessary to secure the passage of the River.,   <i>Sixthly: Are the Forts built by Captain Waggener upon the South Branch to be deemed in the chain intended by the Assembly?</i>,   The Forts built by Captain Waggener have had the desired effect, The inhabitants of that fertile district, keep possessions of their Farms; and seem resolved to pursue their Business under cover of them. They are therefore to be looked upon in the chain intended by the Assembly. The Council are of opinion that it will be found necessary to maintain a Block-house at Pearsalls, to secure that difficult pass, and keep the communication open.,   <i>Seventhly: Which is the next important and convenient place for building on, above the upper fort, built by Captain Waggener? Upon the main branch about twenty miles higher up, where there is a considerable body of inhabitants.</i>,   The men in that Garrison may secure that Settlement, and protect those on the heads of the waters of the South-branch, and those upon Shanandoah River.,   <i>Eighthly: The President asking whether the Council in general were acquainted with the particular situation of the frontiers to the southward of the waters of the South-Branch?</i>,   The Council declared they were not and thought it advisable that the completing the chain should be referred to Captain Hogg with directions to build at or about twenty or thirty miles distance, as the situation of the country requires, or Ground will permit, and to have the particular regard to the body of inhabitants to be defended and the passes most frequented by the Enemy, and that Captain Hogg begin to build, observing the above considerations, to the southward of Fort Dinwiddie, extending the line towards May river, as directed by the Assembly.,   <i>Lastly: The Question being put, How many men were absolutely necessary for the defence of Fort Cumberland against an attack with small arms?</i>,   Notwithstanding the whole number of men raised could be employed to advantage at Fort Cumberland, yet to carry on the intended work, it was necessary to draw off as many as could be possibly spared.,   The Council are of opinion that one hundred and seventy privates is the smallest number that can be left for the defence of the Garrison against small arms: and that nothing more could be expected from that number than to act on the <i>defensive,</i> and do the Duty of the Garrison, with liquor and to suttie.,   The President asked whether Mr. Alexander Woodrow was qualified for that office; and how he had behaved since his appointment to suttie? To which the council answered unanimously, that they thought him a very proper person and well qualified; as he has hitherto behaved with the greatest exactness and conformity to the rules and orders of the Garrison, and with much modesty and gentility. </small>"},{"id":167033,"title":"Edward's Fort Stockade Replica","pos":[39.30255,-78.43293],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=167033","desc":"Edward's Fort Stockade Replica. Preserving Our Colonial Heritage.  ,  This structure replicates the original fortress stockade, erected nearby in late 1755 by early Cacapehon Valley settler, Joseph Edwards. On his homestead, the fortress encompassed Edwards's house, barn, outbuildings, and a spring. The original site of the stockade, known as Edwards's Fort, is just to the northeast a few hundred yards. The original site, the subject of continuing and future archaeological digs, is protected. This site was chosen as representative of the land configuration of the original; and this stockade exhibits the shape ,  determined by limited archeological findings ,  of the original fort, though not entirely complete.,   Following Maj. Gen. Edward Braddock's sound defeat on the Monongahela in July 1755, and the decimation of his officer corps and troop strength, there were no defense forces remaining on the Virginia frontier for protection of the few scattered families who braved weather, privation, and the wilds of settler life. When the Indians, at the instigation of French politicians and led by French officers, began attacking the settlements, homes and farms, killing, raping, burning, looting, and abducting hostages, most settlers fled toward safety ,  east to Winchester or beyond, or south to havens of refuge. Joseph Edwards refused to abandon his home, and with his sons and neighbors, fortified his farm to resist the savage attacks. According to some histories, the fort was attacked at least once and held fast; also unconfirmed are tales of a second attack. Accounts can agree, however: the fort was <i>never taken!</i>,   A measure of the fort's importance is that the largest military engagement during the French and Indian War, on the Virginia frontier (the Battle of Great Cacapehon), took place on April 18, 1756, one mile north of the fort. The battle, an ambush by \"hostiles,\" pitted Virginia Regiment troops from Edwards's Fort against Indians and French officers, and resulted in the deaths of two officers and fifteen private soldiers of the Virginia Regiment, along with a number of wounded; an unknown count of dead and wounded hostiles.,   When the war had moved on, east and north in late 1756-1758, the fortress walls, without a purpose, were allowed to fall, to weather away, or were removed for use in other construction projects.,   This structure suggests what a settler might have been able to accomplish with limited tools, assets and time. This stockade replica is an on-going project and will change over time.

A Road to War</b> ,  When London decided to send Gen. Edward Braddock to the colonies to take over the confrontation with the French, they set in motion events that would lead to a very bloody war on the colonial frontier. Braddock arrived with two regiments of experienced soldiers and a three pronged plan to capture three French strongholds. The first one that he personally would attack was Fort Duquesne at the Forks of the Ohio River (today's Pittsburgh, Penn.).,   In order to get his two regiments through the western wilderness, Gen. Braddock engaged colonial soldiers and his own troops to cut a twelve foot wide avenue through the forests and valleys and over the mountains. Never thinking that he could be defeated, he was actually building a highway to bring the French and their Indian allies to the frontier of Virginia. Just as the road carried his army to defeat on the banks of the Monongahela River, it would carry the victorious enemy to the doors of the settlers of Hampshire County.,   <b>2. Richard Williams Captivity</b> ,  One of the most exciting and heartwarming stories of the French and Indian War in Hampshire County is that of the captivity and escape of Richard Williams. The Williams family were farming on the South Branch River when Richard and a daughter were captured in an Indian raid and taken to Fort Duquesne. While he was locked in a cell at the fort, three \"spirits\" came to him one night and motioned him to follow them over the fort walls. Williams managed get out of the cell and over the wall. He eventually made his way home after a second capture by Indians on the way. He was reunited with his wife. After the way they went in search of their daughter whom they finally found.,   We have this story today because the great Methodist missionary, Francis Asbury, met Richard and heard the story. Asbury was so impressed that he wrote about it in his journal which has come down to us today.,   <b>3. Skirmish on the North River</b> ,   One of the few artifacts of the war that is in a museum today is a set of orders captured from a French office somewhere on the North River. Capt. Pearis was on patrol when he came upon a small band of Indians. In the skirmish a French officer was killed, and Pearis found orders in the officer's pocket that had been issued at Fort Duquesne. They are proof that the French knew about sites in our county and were ordering allied Indians to attack them. Today those orders are in the Virginia Historical Society Museum in Richmond.,   <b>4. Fort Ashby</b> ,   Fort Ashby was a Ranger fort on the Wagon Road from Pearsall's to Fort Cumberland. One incident at the fort showed that the Indians were not foolish about attacking strong forts. Once Indians approached the fort and told the commander to surrender of they would burn the fort and kill the soldiers. The commander refused, and the Indians left. They realized they might loose warriors in this fight, so they just left instead of taking the chance. There were many attacks on settlers around the fort and on supply wagons traveling on the road.,   <b>5. Fort Pearsal</b> ,   Fort Pearsal at present Romney was not attacked by Indians although there were many attacks in the area. However, it is important because it was a place that British allied Indians came as they offered assistance in the war. There are several instances in Col. Washington's letters where we learn of Indians being supplied at the fort or coming to meet with soldiers so they could range the forests together. This fort was an important supply point on the frontier.,   <b>6. Fort Edwards</b> ,   Fort Edwards was the first fort west of Col. Washington's headquarters at Fort Loudoun in Winchester. It served as a point were troops could spend the night and then go on to Pearsal's and Fort Cumberland or turn south and proceed to Fort Pleasant and the southern forts.,   This fort is perhaps best know for the battle that occurred not far from here, the Battle of Great Cacapehon. This was the largest action between Virginia Regiment forces and both French and Indians to take place in Virginia. A force of about one hundred enemy ambushed Capt. John Fenton Mercer and his men several miles from the fort. Capt. Mercer, Ensign Thomas Carter and fifteen men were killed. Several of the enemy were killed.,   This battle took place in April, 1756, the bloodiest month of fighting on this frontier. It horrified all Virginia and made the colony realize that it was in grave danger of widespread enemy attack.,   The brick patio behind the Fort Edwards Visitor Center is a memorial to the men killed in this battle. If you look in the center of the patio you will find memorial bricks to Capt. Mercer and his men.,   <b>7. Daniel Morgan's Narrow Escape</b> ,   One of our great heroes of the war was Daniel Morgan. He had arrived in the Shenandoah Valley at the age of sixteen and began working as a wagoneer. He drove a wagon for Gen. Braddock's ill-fated expedition and lived to tell the tale. Later, he enlisted as a Ranger and was stationed at Fort Ashby. One a trip back to Winchester he was ambushed near \"hanging rock\" and narrowly excaped when he was shot through the back of the neck and mouth. He managed to hang on to his horse's neck and outrun an Indian who tried to scalp him; he rode to Fort Edwards here he recovered. It was his experience as a Ranger on the Virginia frontier that prepared him to become one of the great Generals of the American Revolutionary War. Morgan's riflemen were renowned by the British as a fearsome adversary."},{"id":167164,"title":"Keyes Gap","pos":[39.2602,-77.77078],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=167164","desc":"Keyes Gap. .

Washington Heritage Trail.  ,  Adam Stephen (1720-1791) had a close acquaintance with George Washington through their association with Lord Fairfax and from their military involvements from the French and Indian War through the American Revolution. Stephen was present with Washington at Fort Necessity in 1754, served as second in command of the Virginia militia, and was responsible for troops, at various times, at Fort Loudoun in Winchester, Fort Cumberland, Fort Ligonier, and Fort Pitt. Adam Stephen ran successfully against George Washington for the House of Burgesses seat from Frederick County, Virginia, in 1761. Later, Stephen was promoted in 1777 to the rank of major-general in the Continental Army during the Revolution. His daughter, Ann, was married in 1780 to Alexander Spottswood Dandridge, a second cousin of Martha Washington and a brother-in-law of Patrick Henry.,   The Adam Stephen House is a fine example of late colonial stone architecture. The land on which the house is situated was acquired by Adam Stephen in 1770 as part of a 255-acre tract of land. In 1773, he purchased an adjacent tract of 563 acres, dividing the land into lots and selling them to establish a town. Stephen operated two nearby mills, a distillery and an armory along the Tuscarora Creek, on lands that became the town of Martinsburg in 1778.

West Virginia 9.  ,  Stone House Mansion, predominantly Georgian in style, was constructed in 1757, and is one of the oldest stone structures in Berkeley County. The property is listed in the National Register of Historic Places for its association with the Hite vs. Fairfax lawsuit, which addressed the question of whether the American colonial government or English lords and government had the authority to grant land.,   Specifically, Host Hite obtained thousands of acres of land in this region in 1731 from a land grant obtained by the Van Metre brothers from Virginia Governor Gooch. The English Lord Fairfax claimed ownership of this land through English land grants. Consequently, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act stating that Lord Fairfax should honor all former land grants by the Colony, which upheld the authority of the colonies and eventually helped to precipitate the Revolutionary War. The Stone House Mansion was mentioned in the suit, which spanned several decades and was not settled until after the Revolution, by which time both Hite and Lord Fairfax had died. It was settled, however, in Hite's favor, likely to prevent undermining the new government.,   The house is also significant for its association with its many owners. Among them were John Strode, who built the mansion and lived there during the time of the Hite/Fairfax case. Adam Stephen, founder of Martinsburg, leased the property and later purchased it in 1789. Henry St. George Tucker (for whom Tucker County, West Virginia is named) owned the farm in the early 1800s.

This complex included two roundhouses and two significant shop buildings. The centerpiece of the railroad complex was the West Roundhouse, which can be seen in the immediate foreground. Roundhouse construction started in 1865 and was completed in 1866. The shop buildings, Bridge and Machine Shop and Frog and Switch Shop, were completed in 1867 and the East Roundhouse was completed in 1872. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad needed to re-build quickly to keep up with the competition. The post-war western expansion of the United States was underway, and the reconstruction and growth of the railroads were a key factor in making it possible.,  The shop buildings were designed by architects John Niernsee and James Nielson, and the two roundhouses were based on designs developed by Albert Fink, a noteworthy figure in the evolution of civil engineering in the United States. Fink, a German born and educated engineer working with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, collaborated with Benjamin H. Latrobe, Jr. and developed designs in the early 1850�s using cast iron framing components to support the walls and magnificent roof structures for roundhouses at Grafton and Piedmont, West Virginia. The Fink designs were adapted for the Martinsburg roundhouse, which is the only surviving structure using this creative design.,  Albert Fink went on to become not only a significant designer of railroad bridges and structures, but also a respected railway economist who helped establish a regulatory framework for American railroads that helped restore their financial health in the late 1800�s. As further recognition of his stature as an engineer, in 1880 he served as president of the American Society of Civil Engineers."},{"id":167876,"title":"John Brown","pos":[39.32312,-77.72961],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=167876","desc":"John Brown. . <center> That this nation might have   a new birth of freedom,   That slavery should be removed   forever from American soil.   <b>John Brown</b>   and his 21 men gave their   lives.

Discovered by the Van Bibbers in 1773 it later so impressed George Washington that he and General Andrew Lewis purchased the spring.  ,  The ancient salt lick near by was a salt brine seepage that first attracted buffalo, deer and elk.

Mary Draper Ingles of Virginia, a white prisoner of the Shawnees, was forced to make salt for her captors when the stopped at the lick en route to Kentucky in 1753.  ,  Early settlers used the seepage brine for salt manufacture until David and Joseph Ruffner, searching for a stronger and more plentiful supply, completed drilling of a well in 1808 to a depth of 58 feet by a method they invented. It was the first drilled well in America. Their drilling technique was used to drill many salt wells and a thriving salt industry followed.  ,  In 1841, while drilling for salt at the edge of the burning spring, William Tompkins encountered a strong flow of natural gas which he used under his vats for salt manufacture. This was the first industrial use of natural gas. ,  The burning spring and the salt lick excited and inspired the early pioneers and their descendants to develop the drilling technique, tools, and skills that were later used to drill the first oil well at Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859.

Jefferson County Courthouse.  ,  One of the most famous trials in American history was held in this building in 1859, when John Brown and his followers faced charges of treason against Virginia, inciting slaves to rebel, and murder. Judge Richard Parker presided.<p> The trial began on October 25, a week after the raiders were captured, and ended on November 2. Those tried then and later included Brown, John Cook, John Copeland, Shields Green, Edwin Coppic, Albert Hazlett, and Aaron Stevens. Col. Lewis W. Washington, kidnapped by Brown's men from his home, Beallair, and held hostage, was a principal witness for the prosecution. The jury convicted Brown in forty-five minutes. Brown addressed the court, saying, \"If it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit; so let it be done!\" He and his men were hanged nearby on December 2 and December 16, 1859, and March 16, 1860.<p> On October 18, 1863, Confederate Gen. John D. Imboden attacked Union Col. Benjamin Simpson's Charles Town garrison. Simpson and his infantry took shelter in the courthouse, which Imboden shelled after his surrender demand was refused. The garrison fled, was attacked in a nearby field, and surrendered after Simpson and his staff escaped. Imboden withdrew later that day as additional Union forces arrived.<p> [Text in yellow box reads] The first courthouse here, a two-story building with a cupola but no columns, was completed in 1803. The present Greek Revival-style courthouse replaced it in 1836. The courtroom was on the ground floor, and the judge and court officials sat on an elevated platform behind a railing. The county seat moved to Shepherdstown in 1865 because of wartime damage to the courthouse. It returned to Charles Town in 1872 after the building was repaired. The walls were heightened, a broad cornice was added below the roofline, the bell tower was enlarged, and the clock was added. A new courtroom was created on the second floor. In 1922, leaders of the United Mine Workers were tried here for treason against West Virginia for the coal miners' war (Battle of Blair Mountain). Union leader Bill Blizzard and several others were acquitted. Trials for treason against two states thus were held in this courthouse."},{"id":170262,"title":"The Community Center","pos":[39.49493,-79.81577],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=170262","desc":"The Community Center. .

Interpreting History.  ,  <b>Protecting the Reservoir with Constant Vigilance , </b> The West Virginia Botanic Garden is on the site of the former Tibbs Run Reservoir. Ralph Lemley, the longest serving reservoir caretaker, was first listed as a laborer working for the Morgantown Water Commission in the 1935 city directory. He started to work as the reservoir caretaker in the late 1930s and helped build a house here around 1940. Mr. Lemley was an amateur mechanic who loved to tinker. For instance, he and his father built a tractor by stripping an old milk delivery truck. Ralph was fearless as he drove the tractor down mud-rutted roads that led to the reservoir. As the reservoir caretaker, Ralph adjusted the outlet tower gates to control outflow into the pipe system and treated the water. In order to prevent any seepage or potential embankment failure, he tended to groundhog burrows or overgrowth of vegetation. Mr. Lemley also kept an eye out for trespassers who might contaminate the water. These tasks required his daily attention.,   <b>Supporting a Family with Gardens and Bees</b> ,  Ralph Lemley, his wife Grace, and their three daughters were the only family who lived on this property. Anna Louise, their youngest child, was born here in 1942. After marrying, Anna Louise Lemley Cale and her family lived in the house next door, and the two families shared the land. The house Mr. Lemley helped build has since been removed. Here, in the Eclectic Garden, you can still see the steps going down into the cellar, where the Lemleys stored all the food that they grew and canned. The Lemleys had a big garden. In the summer, it was \"like a buffet\" with so many vegetables, fruit trees and a strawberry patch. Some of the ornamental plants and trees planted by the Lemleys remain here today. Ralph was a beekeeper and kept at least 6 hives behind the little garage. He was also an avid hunter, fisherman, and lover of wildlife.,   <i>[Caption:]</i> ,  <small> Above: Drawing of shared property courtesy of Ralph Cale, grandson of Ralph Lemley.

In 1930 the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation was in the process of building its new electrometallurgical plant in nearby Boncar (later known as Alloy). It was decided a hydroelectric power station would be constructed near Gauley Bridge with a tunnel built n�ar Hawks Nest. This tunnel would divert the water of the New River to provide the needed energy to rotate the turbines. Work soon began on the three mile long Hawks Nest Tunnel, which is still considered a marvel of engineering. For the most part, the tunnel was completed in December of 1932, only eighteen months after construction began. Workers dug from each end of the tunnel and when they met the center lines were only off one inch. ,  Nearly 5,000 men worked on this project, with 3,000 of them working underground. Some were from the local area, but many were African Americans who had migrated, mostly from the southern states, in search of steady work. Completion of this tunnel came at a great cost however. As they cut their way through the mountain, workers were exposed to high levels of pure silica dust. Combined with the confined space, poor ventilation, and lack of breathing protection, the results were disastrous. By 1936, more than 400 deaths had been attributed to silicosis contracted while working in the tunnel. However, some believe that the actual number could be as many as 2,000 as indicated in a 1936 Congressional report which revealed there were another 1,500 men suffering from silicosis contracted while working in the tunnel. The Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster remains the worst industrial disaster in United States history.

Soon after the 1873 completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, coal mines began springing up in the New River Gorge region surrounding Ansted. The nearby Hawks Nest mine was one of the earliest.</b> In 1872, the Gauley-Kanawha Coal Company was organized by Dr. David T. Ansted and George W. Imboden. The following year they opened a mine just below the summit of Gauley Mountain, and in 1875 changed the name to the Hawks Nest Coal Company. A system of mine car tramways was used to transport the coal from Ansted down to the railroad cars at the bottom of the gorge. ,  This area was also the site of West Virginia's first coal strike. On January 12, 1880, West Virginia National Guard troops were dispatched to Hawks Nest to step in and defuse a conflict. Operators at Coal Valley (present day Montgomery) had informed their union miners that the competition from the Hawks Nest mine was hurting their business. Upon hearing this, the Coal Valley miners made their way to Hawks Nest and threatened the miners there with harm if they continued working. ,  William N. Page, manager of the Hawks Nest mine, approached Fayette County Sheriff C.H. McClung who, fearing loss of votes in the upcoming election, offered no help.

The town's name is a remembrance of a British geologist, David T. Ansted, who stalked out the seams of high-grade coal, but today it is difficult to find evidence of this once thriving industry. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., Signal Knob Coal, Hawk's Nest Mining have come and gone, leaving behind \"coal camp\" architecture and the Victorian mansions of William Page, coal company manager, and that of the company's superintendent. Today Ansted looks toward a future working with the environment, not against it. The foundations townsfolk build on are: education, tourism, and quality of life issues. This community of 1700 tucked in the fold of Gauley Mountain and hugging the rim of New River Gorge gains strength and momentum from the past, and welcomes the future as a town eager to share the best of West Virginia's lifestyle - a precious heritage comprised of love of family, respect for your fellow man, and a code of values to live by. ,   ,  Panel 2 - <b>William Nelson Page ,  (January 6, 1854-March 7, 1932)</b> ,  William Nelson Page was a United States civil engineer, entrepreneur, capitalist, businessman and industrialist. ,  Page, as a prot�g� of David T. Ansted, was one of the leading developers of West Virginia's rich bituminous coal fields in the late 19th and early 20th century, as well as being deeply involved in building the infrastructure to transport the mined coal. He came to the area to help build the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and soon became involved in many coal and related enterprises in Virginia and West Virginia. Among his many enterprises, Page partnered with financier Henry Huttleston Rogers to secretly plan and construct the Virginia Railway (VGN), right between two of the country's larger railroads. ,  The well-engineered and highly efficient VGN operated very profitably and came to be know as the \"Richest Little Railroad in the World.\" ,  Page was also a civic leader, a mayor of his hometown of Ansted served in the local militia during the Spanish-American War and later the West Virginia National Guard. He helped found a hospital in 1889. After his retirement in 1917, a ship, which served the US Navy and the merchant marine during both world wars, the S.S. <b><i>William N. Page</b></i>, was named in his honor. ,   ,  Panel 3 - <b>David Thomas Ansted ,  (February 5, 1814 - May 13, 1880)</b> ,  Ansted was born in London on February 5, 1814. He was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, and after taking his degree of M.A. in 1839 was elected to a fellowship of the college. Inspired by the teachings of Adam Sedgwick, his attention was given to geology, and in 1840, he was elected professor of geology in King's College, London, a post which he held until 1853. ,  Meanwhile he became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1844, and from that date until 1847 he was vice-secretary of the Geological Society. The practical side of geology now came to occupy his attention and he visited various parts of Europe and the British Islands as a consulting geologist and mining engineer. ,  Dr. Ansted's Gold-Seekers Manual (1849) attempted to improve the prospects of emigrants to the California gold rush. His other published works include Geology, introductory, descriptive, and practical (1844), The Geologist's Text-Book (1845), Syllabus of lectures on mineralogy, geology, and practical geology...(1848), an elementary course of geology, mineralogy, and physical geography (1850), The Great Stone Book of Nature (1853), The applications of geology to the arts and manufactures...(1865). ,  In 1853, Ansted was one of the earlier geologists to identify the rich bituminous coal seams which lay in southern West Virginia in the United States, where he invested in land. The town of Ansted in Fayette County was named in his honor in 1873. His prot�g�, William N. Page, became a leading industrialist and developer of coal mines and railroads in the area. ,  Dr. Ansted exchanged correspondence with Charles Darwin about 1860. In 1868, Dr. Ansted became an Examiner in Physical Geography to the Science and Art Department of King's College. ,  Ansted died at Melton, near Woodbridge in Suffolk, England on May 13, 1880. ,   ,  Panel 4 - <b>Forgotten Hero</b> ,  The Wright brothers.

Yet 100 years after the Wrights' inaugural flight, and 93 years after the midair catastrophe that killed Paul Peck, who remembers him? ,  Born in Ansted, the son of Lon and Alice Peck of Lewisburg. He also lived for a time in Philadelphia and in Charleston where two brothers settled. ,  Peck's name pops up in the aviation annals, mentioned in the gap between Kitty Hawk and the astounding aeronautical advances forged by two world wars. But in his home state, the achievements of West Virginia's daring, trailblazing birdman remain largely unrecognized. ,  He was the state's first pilot, the 57th licensed by the International Aeronautics Federation. He learned to fly in seven days. Within two weeks, he captured a world flight record. ,  He probably was the first to fly in West Virginia. Historians believe he piloted the first plane to land in Raleigh County and the flight occurred before 1912. ,  He was the first to fly over the U.S. Capitol, setting a speed record of 24 miles in 25 minutes. ,  He set an endurance record, flying over Boston for four hours, 23 minutes and 15 seconds. He also set a record for landing accuracy. ,  When the nation's first aviation military school opened at College Park, Md., in 1911, he was one of the instructors. Rare postcards coveted by collectors commemorate his role in the first U.S. airmail flights. ,   ,  Panel 5 ,  Born in Augusta County, Virginia, on June 25, 1836 George William Imboden became a distinguished attorney, Confederate soldier, and a leading citizen of Ansted. After attending Staunton Academy, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1858. In 1859, he married Mary Frances Tyree, daughter of an Ansted inn keeper. Imboden enlisted in the Southern service on April 16, 1861. He rose to the rank of colonel by December 1862 when he took command of the 18th Virginia Calvary which fought in Chancellorsville and many other battles. ,  Moving to Fayette County in 1870, Imboden actively promoted industrialization of the two Virginias. George was to become attorney for and director of the Gauley Mountain Coal Co., Loop Mountain Coal Company and the Deepwater Railway. ,  Imboden served Ansted and Fayette County from 1890 to 1922, holding office in the House of Delegates (1896), President of the Fayette County Commission (1881-85), First Mayor of Ansted (1891-92), and town recorder (1891-1907). ,  He married Angie M. Dickinson, daughter of a Fayette County pioneer in 1869 after the death of his first wife. His second wife, Angie, renamed their family home \"Contentment\" because she and her family spent many happy hours there. ,  Contentment had been built about 1830 on the James River and Kanawha Turnpike in the west end of what is now Ansted, and they acquired it in 1872. Today, Angie and George Imboden's 1830 home, Contentment, still stands. The Contentment Historical Complex serves as headquarters for the Fayette County Historical Society. It features a historical museum and restored one-room schoolhouse, with historic furnishings and household items dating to mid-nineteenth century. It can be found just a few miles West on US 60 in Ansted. ,   ,  Panel 6 ,  The Gatling gun is a ---ty device, originally powered using a crank. A cylinder of ten barrels, spaced equally around the side of the cylinder, rotates around a central axis. Each barrel fires once per revolution at about the same position. ,  Originally, the Gatling gun was produced in calibres ranging from one inch (25.4 mm) down to 0.45 inch (11.43 mm). ,  The barrels, a carrier, and a lock cylinder were separate and all mounted on a solid plate revolving around a central shaft, mounted on an oblong fixed frame. The carrier was grooved and the lock cylinder was drilled with holes corresponding to the barrels. Each barrel had a single lock, working in the lock cylinder on a line with the barrel. The lock cylinder was encased and joined to the frame. The casing was partitioned, and through this opening the barrel shaft was journaled. In front of the casing was a cam with spiral surfaces. The cam imparted a reciprocating motion to the locks when the gun rotated. Also the casing was a cocking ring with projections to cock and fire the gun. Turning the crank rotated the shaft. Cartridges, held in a hopper, dropped individually into the grooves of the carrier. The lock was simultaneously forced by the cam to move forward and load the cartridge and when the cam was at its highest point the cocking ring freed the lock and fired the cartridge. After the cartridge was fired the continuing action of the cam drew back the lock bringing with it the spent cartridge which was then dropped to the ground. ,  It is believed that the concept for the automatic repeat firing gun was conceived by John Nickol Wood and his brother Marshall Wood. It is known that J.R. Gatlin visited the Wood Brothers in Woodville, (now Ansted, West Virginia) prior to the patent filing. ,   ,  Panel 7 - <b>Julia Neal Jackson (Woodson) ,  1789-1831</b> ,  <b><center>Julia Neale Jackson Woodson was the mother of Confederate General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson. </b> ,  In 1817, she married Jonathan Jackson (1790-1826) of Randolph County, an attorney. They were living in Clarksburg and already had two young children when, on January 21, 1824, their second son, Thomas Jonathan Jackson (later to be know as Confederate General Stonewall Jackson) was born. Then tragedy struck the young family. ,  When young Thomas was only 2 years old, both his father and sister Elizabeth, aged 6, died of typhoid fever. Julia gave birth to Thomas' sister Laura Ann the next day. In 1830, she married another attorney, Blake Baker Woodson, who was appointed clerk of Fayette County. Julia gave birth to another son, William Wirt Woodson, but she died at the age of 33 from childbirth complications on December 4, 1831. ,  The family lived in and around what is now Ansted, West Virginia, where she was buried without a marker in Westlake Cemetery. A historian wrote that her neighbors wrapped her wasted body and buried her in a homemade coffin. ,  After the War, Stonewall Jackson was one of the best remembered and beloved of the war heroes. One of his former soldiers who admired Jackson, Captain Thomas R. Ranson of Staunton, Virginia, remembered the tragic life of Jackson's mother. Ranson went to Ansted, West Virginia and had a marble marker placed over the unmarked grave of Julia Neale Jackson in Westlake Cemetery. ,   ,  Panel 8 - <b>William F. Tyree ,  1808-1883</b> ,  Probably best known as being the owner of the Tyree Tavern or Halfway House, a stagecoach stop on the old James River and Kanawha Turnpike, Col. Tyree was also active in government. He served various terms as Deputy Sheriff and was Sheriff from 1877 until 1881. In 1837, he was appointed as commissioner to superintend the erection of the County Courthouse in Fayetteville. Col. Tyree served the Confederates as Captain of Co. C 22nd Regiment in which he two sons, Andrew and Joseph were also enlisted. George Imboden, Ansted's first mayor, was Tyree's son-in-law. ,  The Tyree Tavern still stands today-probably the oldest building in Fayette County. The structure first served as home to Joseph Skaggs, son of Ansted's first settler, Charles Skaggs. It was next occupied by George Hunter, the postmaster, then re-named Mountain Cove. In 1834 Tyree purchased the Halfway House that later served as headquarters during the Civil War for the Chicago Dragoons. General Rosencrans and General Wise at different times had headquarters in this residence. As late as 1927 Mrs. Joseph Tyree then 85 years old, continued to operate the tavern. It is currently a private residence a few blocks east of this location."},{"id":173345,"title":"Westlake Cemetery","pos":[38.1371,-81.0982],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=173345","desc":"Westlake Cemetery.

The cemetery is best known, however, for the grave of Julia Beckwith Neale Jackson Woodson, the mother of Thomas J. &#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson. She was born on February 28, 1798, in Loudoun County, Virginia, and moved with her family two years later to the Parkersburg vicinity. She married Jonathan Jackson, an attorney, on September 28, 1817, and the couple had four children, including Thomas Jonathan Jackson born on January 21, 1824. Jonathan Jackson died two years later, deeply in debt, leaving his family destitute.,  \tOn November 4, 1830, Julia Jackson married Blake G. Woodson, a man fifteen years her senior, who in 1831 became the court clerk of newly created Fayette County. Mired in poverty despite his position, he resented his stepchildren. When Julia Woodson�s health began to fail in 1831, she sent her children to live with relatives, and Thomas J. Jackson moved to Jackson�s Mill in Lewis County. He returned here once, in the autumn of 1831, to see his mother shortly before she died.,  \tThe exact date of Julia Woodson�s death is uncertain. Her tombstone, erected many years later, states that she died in September 1831. She gave birth to a son, however, on October 7, and other documentary evidence points to a death date of December 4, 1831.

The new county was named after Carter Braxton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The Town of Sutton became the County Seat. The first county court was held in the home of John D. Sutton. ,   ,  <b>When Was The Court House Built?</b> ,  The Braxton County Court House was built in 1881-82. This two-story brick structure was built in Romanesque Style with central bell tower. Construction by Wood and Atchison using plans by C.C. Kimble. The Original concept for the design was reportedly made by Felix J. Baxter, a local resident. The adjacent Jail waas built in 1905.

Originally it was a village known as Newville. In 1809, John D. Sutton settled at the confluence of Granny's Creek and the Elk River, at the edge of the present town. He donated the land for the streets and the public courtyard where the court house and jail now stand. Over the years, \"Newville\" became known as \"Suttonville\", and finally in 1826, was renamed and incorporated as the Town of Sutton, honoring John D. Sutton's land donation. ,   ,  <i>Panel 3</i> ,  <b>Why Is Sutton On The Civil War Trail?</b> ,  Sutton is located on one of the major north-south routes through the region, which made it a significant strategic point where many battles and skirmishes were fought for its control during the Civil War. In officers' memoirs of the 1861 Battle of Carnifex Ferry, Sutton was described as a most important military post in the interior. ,   ,  <b>So What Happened?</b> ,  10,000 Union troops were deployed in and around Sutton on their way to Carnifex Ferry. Among them was William and McKinley, who later became President of the United States. The Union troops stayed five nights, occupying the Camden Hotel, using it as an officers' quarters. Shortly after, the Camden Hotel, along with most of the Town of Sutton, was burned to the ground by Confederate Troops. Only four homes remained standing after the Burning of Sutton. Sutton slowly rebuilt but remained a small, quiet agricultural community until 1890 when the local timber industry boomed. ,   ,  <i>Panel 4</i> ,  <b>What Is The Town Of Sutton Most Known For?</b> ,  Timber. The opening of the Pardee and Curtin Lumber Company in 1889 marked the beginning of the Timber Boom, which lasted approximately 30 years. The town quickly became a commercial center, with many banks, hotels, and shops. Look at the turn of the century architecture and several grand homes throughout the town.

Interpreting History.  , <b> Residents Welcome Tibbs Run Water , </b> Tibbs Run did not supply water to the reservoir here until 1912. It did, however, serve as a public water source earlier. In 1889, the new Union Improvement Company (UIC) purchased 210 acres of land south of here within the Tibbs Run watershed - known as the most reliable and clean water supply in the area. In just five weeks, they were sending water from Tibbs Run through gravity-fed pipes running along Tibbs Run and Deckers Creek to town.<p>  When UIC opened its mains, \"the sparkling water from the mountain springs\" flowed in, reported the Morgantown Weekly Post. UIC demonstrated success by attaching a hose to a fire plug on Front Street (now University Avenue) and throwing a stream of water 1 inch in diameter 100 feet into the air.,   <blockquote><i> \"Oh, who'd a' thought it?' 'Geeminy, don't she spit madly?' and similar expressions were heard from the excited denizen on all sides.\"� The next day some boys took the hose to the courthouse and \"threw a stream of water right into Patrick Henry's face� and several feet over his head.� � Morgantown Weekly Post , </i></blockquote>  <b>How to Supply Enough Clean Water?</b> ,  In order to ensure an adequate supply of water to all residents, water was also drawn from the Monongahela River and local wells. This water was piped a short distance to the water works on the riverfront south of downtown Morgantown. Each source produced a different quality of water, although the Tibbs Run water was almost always considered better. Most people still thought that, if the water was clear, it was safe, which we now know is not true.

Interpreting History.  , <b>The Ideal Spot for a Reservoir , </b> When nearby land was no longer able to supply an adequate amount of water to town, the Union Improvement Company (UIC) searched for a site to build a reservoir. The land you see here was ideal � Tibbs Run water could be captured in a natural �bowl.� In addition, Tibbs Run's upper watershed had remained largely undeveloped, preserving the clean mountain water. When reservoir construction began in early 1911, the land was still heavily forested. Some of the old growth timber found then is still standing today.,   The Union Utilities Company, a successor to the UIC, acquired water rights within the watershed leading to (but not adjoining) the reservoir in early 1912. The landowners promised not to pollute the waters as part of the agreement. These water rights transferred through subsequent deeds, and some of that land. is now protected as part of the Snake Hill Wildlife Management Area.,   <b>Diversion Dam Meets 1912 and Future Needs , </b> The first steps in reservoir construction entailed diverting the flow of Tibbs Run water so a small diversion dam was built. This structure was about 8 feet high by 30 feet wide. During reservoir construction, water pooled behind this dam in the natural stream channel and was diverted to the pipeline leading to town. After construction, water behind the dam was routed west into the reservoir basin through a 24-inch-diameter terra-cotta pipe. Nearing the reservoir, the pipe crossed Jones Run inside a short concrete aqueduct, seen to your left, before ending at the basin. This \"off-stream reservoir� design was unique for the time period. This method was most likely chosen because it allowed the clean Tibbs Run water to enter the reservoir without mixing with the more polluted Jones Run, which was then kept outside the reservoir. In 1948, a small wooden weir, pipe into the reservoir, and control box were built to allow Jones Run to act as a s�pplemental water supply. The concrete control box with a steel plate on it can be seen along the trail.,   <i>[Captions:]</i> ,  <small> Aerial photo showing Tibbs Run Reservoir location and features, including Tibbs Run d�version dam and Jones Run wooden weir.

Interpreting History.  ,  Clearing the overgrowth from 28 acres for a reservoir here was a major undertaking in 1911. Men used hand saws and axes to cut and remove trees and surface growth. Teams of horses or oxen pulled away the debris and any usable timber. A small contractor's ream then grubbed out the stumps - a difficult job. \"The grubbing was done by means of a stump-puller and a two-horse team, excepting in very difficult places, where it was done with hand labor, using mattocks and shovels, aided by blasting\" (The Cornell Civil Engineer, 1911).,   A stump pulling device was constructed on-site under the guidance of Victor Hammel, who led the effort. The power of two horses, strategically placed chains, and the use of nearby stumps still anchored in the ground allowed the workers to systematically uproot any stump to which they could properly connect.,   Every single piece of the entangled trees' root systems needed to be removed before horse-drawn scrapers could contour the loamy sand, clay and gravel. The grading process shaped the bottom of the impoundment area while also collecting the needed fill material for the main dam and embankments. Removal of soil also limited underwater decay of any leftover plant material once the reservoir filled. Some of the sand and gravel removed was used to make concrete which was later used to build the spillway.,   The 30-foot-wide stepped concrete spillway, seen to your left, directed excess water out of the reservoir and back into Tibbs Run. Releasing the excess here in those rare times of extremely high water prevented erosion from occurring elsewhere. Because of the size of the pipes bringing water into the reservoir, during periods of high rainfall much of the water in the upper watershed remained in the creeks rather than entering the reservoir.

The core was most likely clay and may have included concrete (made with the sand cleared from the basin). Larger stones were added to the inner face of the dam to prevent erosion by wave action. A dinky locomotive engine and dumper cars, which ran along a small track, made construction easier. The engine likely pulled loads of dirt and other materials along the dam to the work crews.,   <b>The Outlet Tower Lets Water Out� , </b> The tower you see here, along with a system of pipes, transferred the water in the reservoir to Morgantown. The concrete tower is approximately 21 feet tall. The 3 levels of side intake openings were controlled by hand from atop the tower. Using a walkway to access the top of the tower, the reservoir caretaker could open or close the intake gates, depending on water levels and need. With the lake filled to a normal depth, only the tower's top portion was visible above the water. The incoming water collected in the bottom of the tower and entered the main outlet pipe. This concrete-sealed 24-inch diameter pipe passed under the dam's core and connected to pipes leading to town.,   <i>[Inset:] , </i> <blockquote> Morgantown Post Chronicle November 27, 1912 ,  <b>Engineer McCoy Finishes Job on Tibbs Run Dam</b> ,  \"The water from Tibbs Run was turned into the big lake, the valves of the gatehouse in the big dam were closed, and the reservoir, capable of storing 90,000 gallons of water, began to fill.... The four days run has formed a lake of goodly area and of seven or eight feet depth in the deeper places. It is an attractive looking sheet of beautifully clear, pure mountain water.... The cost of the improvement to the company has probably approximated $50,000.\"</blockquote>"},{"id":174320,"title":"Rotary Club of Parkersburg","pos":[39.2668,-81.55837],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=174320","desc":"Rotary Club of Parkersburg.

At this site, on February 8, 1919, a group of twenty seven leading citizens of Parkersburg met at the Chancellor Hotel to organize the Rotary Club of Parkersburg while petitioning the International Association of Rotary Clubs for a charter. Leading the effort was local attorney at law, John Marshall, who would later become Deputy Attorney General of the United States. The Rotary Club of Parkersburg received its charter on March 1, 1919, only fourteen years after the first club was formed in Chicago, Illinois. At that time, the club chose to meet weekly every Monday at 12:15 pm. in the \"parlors of the Chancellor Hotel.\" As the city and nation grew, the club continued to meet at the hotel until the 1970�s when the Chancellor closed and was eventually demolished on this site. 100 years later, the club, made up of a diverse group of business men and women, continues its Monday luncheon meetings while engaging in various community service projects.

There, sediments settled, and the water was chemically treated. When the water level is very low, you can still see the remains of this wall. A chemical feed house was also built here in 1935. It housed a scale, hopper to feed lime into a mixing box,band an electric-driven Gould pump to pull water out of the reservoir into the mixing box. Then, the lime mixture went back into the reservoir. Chlorine was added to the reservoir through a separate line from this house and back into mixing chambers along the enclosure walls.

Armed with six 50-caliber M-3 aircraft machine guns, 24 5-inch rockets and 6.000 pounds of bombs, the Thunderstreak was designed as a fighter-bomber capable of attacking ground targets and intercepting high-altitude Soviet bombers.,  At least 2,711 examples of this model were ultimately produced with 2,112 under the Republic banner and 599 built by General Motors. NATO allies received 1,301 models with the rest going to the United States Air Force's Tactical Air Command (TAC). The USAF Thunderbirds aerial demonstration team had begun their air shows in the early 1950s with the F-84G Thunderjet. Always trying to display the most advanced fighters of the age, the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak became the team's new aircraft in 1955. The F-84F was retired from USAF active service in 1964 and relegated to duty in the Air National Guard until discontinuing use in 1971.,  The Thunderstreak you're standing near was purchased by Carley McCoy at an open auction for fifty dollars at the Morgantown Airport in 1963 he and erected the stand to place it as a landmark for Blacksville.

Star City was founded in 1907 and named by Louis Kauffeld, general manager of the Star Glass Company. Kauffeld's factory was the first oil lamp chimney producer in West Virginia and made 72 different kinds of lamp chimneys.,   \"Beacon\" utilizes the raw ingredients used in glass making. Sandstone is the main ingredient in glass making. Sandstone is pulverized to make silica then melted to make glass. Coal was used as the source of heat in the process. Limestone was added to give color to the glass. While researching this sculpture, I visited Davis-Lynch glass company in Star City. They donated the glass chunks used in \"Beacon\". Coal, sandstone, and limestone were items I found in and along the Monongalia river.

Many delegates from western Virginia withdrew from the convention and vowed to form a state government loyal to the Union.,   After the victory at the Battle of Philippi on June 3, 1861, Union forces occupied northwestern Virginia. Secure from Confederate interference, a new convention met in Wheeling and formed the Restored Government of Virginia, which President Lincoln recognized as the state's legitimate government.,   The U.S. Constitution allows for the formation of a new state from an existing one if the original state consents. Since the federal government accepted the Restored Government as legal authority, the state granted itself permission.

They terraced the 3.5-acre cemetery into three levels. A central path connected the terraces and a stone wall was built to enclose the grounds.,   On June 14, 1868, Union veterans, townspeople, and local and state dignitaries gathered to dedicate the picturesque cemetery.

As the death toll rose, the U.S. government struggled with the urgent but unplanned need to bury fallen Union troops. This propelled the creation of a national cemetery system.,   On September 11, 1861, the War Department directed commanding officers to keep �accurate and permanent records of deceased soldiers.� It also required the U.S. Army Quartermaster General, the office responsible for administering to the need of troops in life and in death, to mark each grave with a headboard. A few months later, the department mandated interment of the dead in graves marked with numbered headboards, recorded in a register.,   <b>Creating National Cemeteries</b> ,   The authority to create military burial grounds came in an Omnibus Act of July 17, 1862. It directed the president to purchase land to be used as �a national cemetery for the soldiers who shall die in the service of the country.� Fourteen national cemeteries were established by 1862.,   When hostilities ended, a grim task began. In October 1865, Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs directed officers to survey lands in the Civil War theater to find Union dead and plan to reinter them in new national cemeteries. Cemetery sites were chosen where troops were concentrated: camps, hospitals, battlefields, railroad hubs. By 1872, 74 national cemeteries and several soldiers� lots contained 305,492 remains, about 45 percent were unknown.,   Most cemeteries were less than 10 acres, and layouts varied. In the Act to Establish and to Protect National Cemeteries of February 22, 1867, Congress funded new permanent walls or fences, grave markers, and lodges for cemetery superintendents.,   At first only soldiers and sailors who died during the Civil War were buried in national cemeteries. In 1873, eligibility was expanded to all honorably discharged Union veterans, and Congress appropriated $1 million to mark the graves. Upright marble headstones honor individuals whose names were known; 6-inch-square blocks mark unknowns.,   By 1873, military post cemeteries on the Western frontier joined the national cemetery system. The National Cemeteries Act of 1973 transferred 82 Army cemeteries, including 12 of the original 14, to what is now the National Cemetery Administration.,   <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  <b>Reflection and Memorialization</b> ,  The country reflected upon the Civil War's human toll, 2 percent of the U.S. population died. Memorials honoring war service were built in national cemeteries. Most were donated by regimental units, state governments and veterans' organizations such as the Grand Army of the Republic. Decoration Day, later Memorial Day, was a popular patriotic spring event that started in 1868. Visitors placed flowers on graves and monuments, and gathered around rostrums to hear speeches. Construction of Civil War monuments peaked in the 1890s. By 1920, as the number of aging veterans was dwindling, more than 120 monuments had been placed in the national cemeteries.,   <b>(captions)</b> ,  Soldiers' graves near General Hospital, City Point, Va., c. 1863.

One popular story holds �S. Ferguson� to have been an �old pioneer� who came to grief in 1814 while traveling from Virginia to the Kanawha Valley. After riding all day on Old Bluestone Road from Pack�s Ferry on New River, Ferguson reached the ford of Piney Creek near the current sewage treatment plant. His horse, frightened by a bear or panther running from the bush, threw him into the stream, breaking his leg. The horse ran away and showed up several days later at the Ferguson home in Franklin County.<p>  Backtracking, his family eventually discovered his corpse on the stream bank. He had died after carving his epitaph into a nearby rock: �S. Ferguson F. County 1814.� Oddly, the figure �4� was carved backwards. The family buried his remains on the spot, without a coffin, leaving the rock in the creek bed.<p>  Early county historian Judge Winton A. Riffe related a far less romantic tale. He contended S. Ferguson was more �a member of the noted Ferguson fur-trapping family of Franklin County, Virginia.� The carved rock probably marked a camp site rather than his death site.<p>H  A construction firm came across the rock in 1939 and moved it to the foot of Ferguson�s grave, the head having by then been asphalted over. Beckley resident Ray Sutphin rescued the rock again in 1984, when he had it transported from the plant site to his home. There it rested until donated to the city by James Bays and Amy Kirk in November 2017, urged by the Raleigh County Historical Society (RCHS).

The Jarvis family, including Mother's Day founder Anna Jarvis, occupied the upper stories and it was there that Anna spent much of her girlhood.

In 1888, following a visit to the area by a Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W, now Norfolk Southern Corporation) survey crew, Wallace Williamson formed the Williamson Mining and Manufacturing Company. With advance knowledge that the main line of the railroad would run through the area, he subdivided family-owned land surrounding a planned railroad depot near the West Virginia-Kentucky state line. In 1892 the new town of Williamson was surveyed, and lots were laid out and sold at auction. ,  The railroad reached Williamson the same year, assuring the town almost immediate prosperity. By 1894, four daily passenger trains serviced Williamson�s new frame depot. In 1895 a portion of western Logan County was split off and became Mingo County. Williamson, with barely 100 inhabitants, was chosen as the county seat, primarily due to the influence of the N&W. ,  By 1900 the N&W had established a divisional hub and built extensive rail yards at Williamson to service the booming southwestern West Virginia coal industry. The Williamson yards eventually rivaled those at Bluefield in importance, and grew larger in size, exceeded only by the company�s main yards at Roanoke, Virginia. ,  Williamson was incorporated as a city in 1905, and its population and economy boomed with the development of the local coal fields. From a population of 27 in 1893, Williamson peaked at an estimated 10,000 persons about 1925. ,  The East Williamson Rail Yard is one of the largest coal marshalling yards in the world.

Nature's Gifts of Stone, Clay and Water.  ,  The Mary Price Ratrie Greenspace has transformed an ordinary asphalt parking lot across the street from the Clay Center into a slice of West Virginia natural heritage. The site features stacked terraces that establish a backdrop resembling the southern Appalachian Mountains comprised of a rocky stream fed by recycled rooftop stormwater and a small forest of native plants.,   Stormwater moves from the adjacent building into a large cistern system and is pumped up to feed the stream and pool. During heavy rainfall, the stream will flow generously but will slow down to a trickle in a dry period. Feel free to explore by climbing the rocks and enjoying the water flowing over the waterfalls and through the stream.,   <b><i>Sandstone</b></i> ,  You will find golden sandstone in the stepped walls and reflection pool. Sandstone is made by silica being compressed for 200-310 million years from the weight of ancient sea bottoms and beaches. Seas and vast lakes deposit layers of sand hundreds of feet thick, creating great pressure and heat, cementing the sands into stone. Early settlers of the Kanawha Valley carved and cut this stone from river and lake banks. Below you'll see a cliff where the now shrunken rivers still flow. Local settlers cut such exposed stone into blocks to build the grand beginnings of homes, hearths, bridges and the buildings of culture and civilization. Feel free to touch the golden stone and feel the grit of the sandpaper-like walls.,   <b><i>Limestone</b></i> ,  Like sandstone, limestone is a sedimentary rock. However, instead of a sand origin, limestone forms from decaying sea shells and shelled creatures, which are made of calcium. The calcium builds up for hundreds of feet and becomes the hard stone of underground caves. Much of the West Virginia Capitol building is made from limestone, which is harder than some rock, but easy to cut and carve.,   The limestone in this greenspace is called bluestone, which is the material found within the waterfalls. Limestone gravel is also located under the boulder monument sign as a strong base to support its giant mass. That stone weighs 30,000 pounds; about the weight of six cars.,   <b><i>Brick</b></i> ,  The Kanawha Valley is rich with clay in the hills and river and was home to several brick mines. The method of laying brick pavement in the United States was invented by Mr. M. Levi, a Charlestonian, and a piece of it was first laid on Summers Street in 1870, as an experiment. In 1873 the entire block, closest to the Kanawha River, was paved using this method.,   Although paving streets with brick didn't begin until 1870, utilizing brick as a building material has been around for at least 5,000 years. The longevity bricks have indured as a building material throughout the ages is largely due to the fact that they are made from clay, a mineral that is found abundently in nature."},{"id":178505,"title":"Veterans Memorial","pos":[37.6726,-82.27823],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=178505","desc":"Veterans Memorial. .

Welch is named for Captain Isaiah Welch, a surveyor whose accounts of rich coal seams in the Elkhorn Valley helped encourage development of the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W, now Norfolk Southern Corporation). In 1888 Captain Welch bought land at the confluence of Elkhorn Creek and Tug Fork, in anticipation of the arrival of the railroad. The rail line reached Welch in 1891. The city became the McDowell County seat in 1892 and was incorporated in 1894. Within a few years, more than 30 mines were in operation nearby, bringing a large influx of both native-born and foreign mine workers to the area. ,  Welch is probably best known for two very different events: the 1921 murder of Sid Hatfield and the 1960 visit of presidential candidate John F. Kennedy. ,  On August 1, 1921, former Matewan Police Chief Sid Hatfield and Deputy Ed. Chambers were killed on the steps of the McDowell County courthouse by operatives of the Baldwin-Felts detective agency in retaliation for the killing of several of their men in Matewan on May 19, 1920. Outrage over their murders led to the Batttle of Blair Mountain in which federal and state troops defeated the miners and thwarted the United Mine Workers� attempts to organize the southern West Virginia coal fields. ,  John F. Kennedy visited Welch twice during the 1960 Democratic Primary campaign, speaking out against the �poverty, want, and Hunger� that he saw in the region. Kennedy�s experiences in Welch and nearby led to the development of the nationwide Food Stamp program and other anti-poverty legislation for Appalachia. ,  The commercial heart of Welch was concentrated along McDowell and Wyoming streets, near the N&W Railway station. A 1911 fire destroyed many of the town�s wooden buildings, which were replaced by brick and stone buildings constructed by Italian stone masons employed by the N&W. By the early 1920s, Welch contained two dozen coal company offices, a state hospital, and a thriving commercial district. Welch�s economic fortunes have risen and fallen with those of the regional coal industry, however. Mine closings, the increasing mechanization of the industry, and the diversion of rail traffic away from Welch during, the post-World War II era led to a decline in the local and regional economy. Flooding throughout the past century, including the devastating floods of 2001 and 2002, have also damaged the town, but have led to revitalization efforts along the Tug Fork riverfront. ,  <i>(newspaper article reproduced on the panel)</i> <center><small><b>SID HATFIELD SLAIN BEFORE COURT HOUSE</b></small>  ,  Noted Figure in Recent West Virginia Mine Troubles , Is Killed in a Gun Fight.  ,  <small>COMPANION ALSO SHOT DEAD</small>  ,  Chief Witness in Mingo County Trial , Arrested Pending Investigation of Shooting..  <blockquote>W<small>ELCH, W.

Welch. The topography of Welch and surrounding area consists of steep hills, V-shaped valleys, and sharp ridges. Welch is tucked into this rugged terrain, with the town built on the narrow valley floor, less than 1,000 feet wide in places, of Tug Fork and its tributaries. It was through this unique landscape that the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W, now Norfolk Southern Corporation) built its railroad lines in the late 19th century, so that trains could access Southern West Virginia�s bounty of high quality coal and transport it to the rest of the country. Due to the rugged landscape, building of the rail line required construction of many bridges and tunnels in this area. ,  The Heartland Corridor rail clearance project involved a series of engineering efforts undertaken to allow trains to transport double-stacked containers of cargo through tunnels and across bridges along the Norfolk Southern rail line between the Port of Virginia and Columbus, Ohio and other destinations in the Midwest. Improvements were made to tunnels and bridges along the route, and terminals in Portsmouth and Columbus were upgraded to process the increased amounts of goods transported. The project was funded by the federal government; state agencies in Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio; and Norfolk Southern Corporation. ,  Clearance was increased in 28 tunnels (10 located within five miles of Welch; see map to right), and 24 other overhead obstructions were cleared. Of the 28 tunnels modified, 15 needed to have the roof excavated and the liner replaced. Seven tunnels were notched to allow passage of the containers, and tracks were lowered or realigned at six tunnels. Many of the tunnels also required drainage improvements. In total, 5.7 miles of tunnel were modified. ,  Construction for the Heartland Corridor project began in October 2007 and was completed in September 2010. As part of this work, Norfolk Southern Corporation sponsored documentation of 116 bridges and tunnels along the old N&W line between Belspring, Virginia, and Bull, West Virginia. Norfolk Southern Corporation and the federal and state agencies involved are proud of their cooperation and achievement.

However, the nation's trails were largely unnavigable. In the 1920's WV invested $50 million in improvements making Midland Trial the state's first through route. In 1924 the U.S. Highway System formed to improve wayfinding and maintenance of our nation's roads. Midland Trail was designated U.S. Route 60, was the first transcontinental highway. AAA issued this guide book to the entire coast to coast route from Virginia Beach to Los Angeles.,   <i><b>Chemical Capital of the World</i> 1920 - Present</b> ,  Salt is at the core of Midland's history. The buffalo that beat out this path came to The Great Buffalo Licks at Kanawha Salines, present day Madlen, which became famous for salt production in the 1800's. Mary Ingles made salt for her Shawnee captors in 1755.,   Salt is sodium chloride. In the 1920's salt spawned the chemical industry. Union Carbide and FMC made chlorine. DuPont made ammonia from coal. In the World War II era, DuPont Belle produced Nylon intermediaries used in parachutes, brushes, and Nylon stockings. As more scientists, inventors, capitalists, and project came, new chemical products and intermediaries were invented and the Kanawha VAlley became known as the <i>Chemical Capital of the World.</i>,   <b>WV Coal is King! 1800's - Present</b> ,  WV Coal not only fuels much of America's electricity, but makes up 49% of US coal exports (2012). Huge piles of coal can be seen at tippling sites from Kenova to eastern Fayette. Coal transportation spurred expansion of the railroad and improvements in the Kanawha River to allow for larger vessels. Today, coal is transported by railroad, truck, and barge. Each modern barge carries 1,500 tons of coal, replacing 15 train cars or 58 coal trucks. ThisEach modern barge carries 1,500 tons of coal, replacing 15 train cars or 58 coal trucks. This 9-barge tow holds 13,500 tons of coal, valued at $918,000 when coal is $68/ton.,   <b>Quilts and Feed Sack Fashion 1930 - Present</b> ,  Quilting and sewing have been a part of Appalachian culture since European settlers arrived. During the Great Depression, enterprising rural housewives began utilizing the colorful cloth from empty feed bags to make clothes and quilts. IT took 3 feed sacks to make a dress, and smaller scraps were used in patchwork quilts.,   Cabin Creek Quilts, started in 1970 by VISTA volunteers, helped the wives and widows of farmers and miners turn their handmade quilts into a national sensation. WV quilts have been shown at the Smithsonian and owned by three US Presidents and scores of celebrities.,   <b>10 Hot Dogs for $1 1940's - 1980's</b> ,  Before chain restaurants, small family-owned diners served home-style food to automotive travelers.

In 1951, Alex Schoenbaum, expanded his Parkette Drive-In and Bowling Alley in Rt. 60 in Charleston using a Big Boy hamburger franchise. From this, he built Shoney's into one of America's largest family restaurant chains.,   <b>Roadside Attractions 1950's - Present</b> ,  Traveling U.S. Rt. 60 in this era was a treat marked by both natural and manmade attractions. Hawks Nest State Park, overlooking the Grand Canyon of the East, is alongside tourist shops offering coal figurines, peacock chenille bedspreads, Daniel Boone coonskin caps and Civil War trinkets. The last remaining such icon, The Mystery Hole, is marked by the Volkswagen protruding from a colorful QUonset hut, and constructed over a hole that defies the laws of gravity as balls roll uphill, chairs sit halfway up a wall and visitors are amazed.,   <b>From the Mild to the Wild! 1968 - Present</b> ,  The rugged mountain terrain of Fayette County offers mild recreation ,  fishing, hunting, hiking and biking trails, a tram ride to the bottom of the Gorge and scenic drive overlooks.

Kanawha Valley's 1st settlement flourished as a hub for the shipping trade, manufacturing flatboats, barrels and soon the salt business. Kanawha flat oaters became world-renowned as they transported goods to Cincinnati and New Orleans. Westbound pioneers salvaged wood from their flatboats to build cabins. By 1824 steamboats navigated the Kanawha daily and flatboats and steamboats held races.,   <b>Civil War 1861 - 1865 / A New State 1863</b> ,  The Civil War turned neighbor against neighbor in this region, as several important battles were fought all along the Midland Trail. Gauley Bridge, gateway to Kanawha Valley and originally with the South was taken and retaken 3 times and its bridge burned twice, last by retreating Confederate soldiers in 1862.

Moore Riverfront Park was developed in the aftermath of the devastating flood of May 2002. Several buildings along McDowell Street in the downtown area were damaged repeatedly to an extent that some of the structures had to be demolished for safety reasons rather than being repaired again. The City Council and Mayor of Welch had several goals to utilize the newly emptied space in the downtown area. The city wanted to create a space that would display vision and imagination; enhance the quality of life for residents, visitors and businesses; develop a visually pleasing environment for the downtown area that not only included green spaces with access to the river for recreation, but also streetscape improvements which would emphasize and play off the historic value of the City; and connect the new downtown development with Linkous Park, a more traditional park that includes tennis courts, swimming pool and miniature golf, skateboard park and walking train. ,  The designers felt that it was necessary to preserve some of the existing elements of the site. Therefore, during construction, the foundation walls of the razed structures were left in place to provide additional historic character. In addition, remnants of a basement in one of the razed structures was transformed into an amphitheater rather than being filled in. The project was designed to withstand flooding and make flood cleanup simple and quick. In fact, the new park successfully withstood flooding during construction resulting in minimal cleanup and loss of contractor time. Improvements to the park were designed to complement the existing historical downtown. The park embraces the Tug River and its effect on the city rather than ignoring it or fearing its periodic flooding. ,  The park received the 2009 General Design Honor design award from the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA). The park was designed by the staff of Triad Engineering of Dunbar, West Virginia. Joe Young was the landscape architect on the project and presented the project in completion.

Certified by the National Register of Historic Places in 2006, the District contains almost 350 individual resources, including homes, commercial buildings, a former hospital, brick paved streets, and a cemetery. The buildings include many examples of the various architectural styles popular between the late 1890s and 1950s, including the Queen Anne, Neo-Classical, Colonial Revival, Dutch Revival, and American Foursquare styles; other buildings were built without reference to any formal style, but reflect the historic building traditions common in this part of West Virginia. Taken together, these buildings reflect the growth and maturity of Williamson resulting from the coal, timber, and railroad development beginning in the 1890s and spanning the next half-century.,   Most of the earliest buildings in Williamson were of wood, reflecting the abundant forests in the region. Many of these earliest buildings were destroyed in a series of fires that ravaged the community; the most serious of these occurred in 1906 and destroyed more than 20 buildings. As Williamson rebuilt, masonry became the favored building material. Many town streets were paved with brick beginning in 1904. Much of the paving was the work of Thoney Pietro, a renowned Italian immigrant contractor based in Fairmount; portions of brick pavement can still be seen along 5th and 6th avenues.,   The Williamson Historical Foundation was created to \"preserve the historical and architectural heritage of the community of Williamson so that the future may learn from our past.\" As part of that effort, the Foundation has developed a self-guided tour of the Williamson Historic District, which contains a map as well as detailed information on selected structures and other resources in the district.,   Williamson experienced an accelerated building boom in 1927, during which nearly one billion dollars in new construction occurred, including several public buildings, a community hospital, apartment buildings, and numerous private homes.,   During the 1930s, the residential sections of Williamson expanded north of the N&W rail yards; the latter formed a central spine between the residential and commercial parts of the town, with Tug Fork and South Williamson, Kentucky, located to the south.,   Other historic buildings are located in the commercial section of Williamson south of the railroad tracks and outside the Historic District; these railroad tracks and outside the Historic District; these include the Mountaineer Hotel, a Neo-Classical structure that was completed in 1926.

They settled in tight-knit communities where parents taught their children their native languages and customs at home.

By the 1950s, McDowell County was the leading coal producer in the United States. ,  In the late 1800s and early 1900s, experienced coal operators from Pennsylvania migrated to McDowell County. They opened mines and established towns, building company owned houses, churches, schools, and stores near the rail line. Due to the small native workforce available, coal companies recruited workers from the Pennsylvania coalfields, the American South, and Eastern Europe to work in the mines. The population quickly increased peaking at 98,887 in 1950. ,  In addition to those working in the coal and railroad industries, doctors, lawyers, bankers, and merchants moved into McDowell County. They settled in towns located outside of the company towns and established businesses. Towns including Kimball, Welch, Iaegar, Davy, Anawalt, and War became merchant centers and railroad towns. ,  After the 1950s, McDowell County fell on tough times.

Many American Indian tribes lived here and desired to protect their ways of using the land. While relying on the hunting prowess of Indians to create a lucrative international animal skin economy, the French and British claimed the land as their own. The land was difficult to possess to the exclusion of others. Indian tribes each had different allegiances and different views on the limits of European encroachment. With few settlers, the French struggled to populate an army. the British struggled to finance an ever growing army as settlers demand military protection while moving further and further west. Yet within 50 years, a conflict already 150 years old would end.,   <b>French and Indian War, 1754-1763 (America) ,  Seven Years War, 1756-1763 (Europe) , </b> In May 1754, encouraged by Ohio Valley Indians and the governor of Virginia, Major George Washington marched soldiers to occupy the forks of the Ohio River (present day Pittsburgh). The French built Ft. Duquesne first, but the Virginians and Iroquois defeated French soldiers at Jumonville Glen; a battle with less than 100 men which launched a war fought across the world as far away as the Philippines. Virginia soldiers built 40+ forts along the frontier to protect settlers from the French and their Indian allies while, to protect settlers from the French and their Indian allies while the British allied Cherokee and Catawba carried on an offensive war all along the Ohio River. The British enticed the Shawnee and Delaware to abandon the French in exchange for restricting settlers to the east side of the Appalachian Mountains. The French capitulated and the British occupied their forts, but the frontier remained contested.,   <b>The Battle of Point Pleasant in Dunmore's War, 1774</b> ,  Illegal settlement and retaliatory raids escalated into war in 1774, after Virginians murdered the family of peaceful Mingo Chief Logan, who avenged his family with a series of raids. Virginia's Royal Governor Lord Dunmore raised two armies to respond. Cornstalk, now the Principal Shawnee Chief along with about 1200 Shawnees, Delawares, Mingoes, and Ottawas attacked General Andrew Lewis and about 800 Virginians before the two armies could unite. Cornstalk moved to surprise Lewis early on the morning of October 10th, but two soldier warned the main body. Lewis counterattacked and heavy losses ensued in the fight north of the Kanawha River and east of the Ohio River. Unable to destroy the Virginians, Cornstalk withdrew. Eventually he signed the Treaty of Camp Charlotte ceding all land east of the Ohio River to the British and maintaining peace for three years.,   <b>Pontiac's War (War for the Middle Ground), 1763-4</b> ,  American Indians did not agree to cede their land to the British. More significantly, new British trading policies, such as the abolition of gift giving during a trade, offended Indian cultural practices. Ottawa Chief Pontiac initiated an assault against Ft. Detroit in May 1763 and his ideas spread until settlements from New York to Virginia were under attack by numerous tribes. Locally, Shawnee War Captain Cornstalk led raids up the Kanawha River and nearby watersheds. In October, King George III issued the Proclamation of 1763 forbidding British settlers from moving west passed the Appalachian Mountains, hoping this would resolve the conflict. It did not both illegal settlement and retaliatory raids continued.,   <b>American Revolution and Expansion, 1777-1794 , </b> Cornstalk journeyed to Fort Randolph in 1777 to warn the Virginians that some tribes were joining the British in the American Revolution. He was detained to prevent the Shawnee from joining the British. While protected as a detainee, he was murdered by newly arrived soldiers, whose families had been killed during Cornstalk's raids in 1763. This re-ignited the fighting along the Ohio River during the American Revolution and beyond when the British encouraged Indian raids against the United States from their Canadian forts. The fighting did not end until 1794 when General Anthony Wayne won the battle of Fallen Timbers and the Shawnee ceded land west of the Ohio River.

This extensive network of 140+ forts in Virginia helped the United States gain control of the Ohio River Valley in 1794.,   <b>Siege of Fort Randolph</b> ,  The Shawnees declared war on the Virginians after the murder of Principal Chief Cornstalk. In May 1778, a small force attempted to lure soldiers out of the fort, but Captain William McKee and his men remained inside. When asked to surrender, McKee sent his refusal by the Grenadier Squaw, the sister of Cornstalk who still sought peace between the combatants. The Shawnees attacked the fort, but could not dislodge the Virginians. Instead, they gathered and slaughtered nearby cattle and moved up the Kanawha River looking for more vulnerable targets.

It's safe to say that the concept of the diamond was finalized sometime in the year 1912. Founder Armstrong made many drawings in various styles and forms, shields, odd shapes and diamonds. After some time of self-reflection, he finally selected the diamond as being the most attractive to him. The first design was flat, with a beveled edge and no raised scroll.

There were maximum income limits also, based on family size. The monthly rents ranged from $20 for 3 1/2 rooms to $21.25 for 6 rooms and included steam heat, hot and cold water, electricity, and gas for cooking and refrigeration; the stove and refrigerator were also supplied. The grounds were landscaped with a variety of flowers, bushes and trees, had drying yards, and contained a playground with a water basin for summer use.

All buildings were three story, multi-colored blonde brick structures in the International Style. Regardless of size, each unit had a living room, one bathroom, and a combined kitchen/dining room or kitchen with separate dining room. Buildings had interior bicycle racks and perambulator storage, and those with basements contained central laundry facilities, playrooms, and incinerators.,   In 2010, as a result of the changed approach to high density housing projects, Littlepage Terrace was razed and rebuilt in smaller cluster style projects and more emphasis given to integrating housing through the community.

It opened to throngs of residents flocking to be served double-deck Big Boy hamburgers by smiling carhops in the windows of their big American \"Shoney-shine\" cars.

In 1951, Schoenbaum enlisted Bob Wian, of Bob's Big Boy of California and David Frisch of Frisch's Big Boy of Ohio to incorporate the Big Boy name with concept and then divided the country into franchised territories.

Kimball. The town of Kimball was named for Frederick Kimball, Norfolk and Western Railway�s (N&W, now Norfolk Southern Corporation) second president, serving from 1881-1903. Frederick Kimball was a civil engineer with an interest in geology who helped to develop the Pocahontas coalfields in Virginia and West Virginia. ,  Kimball is representative of the many coal company towns that developed along the N&W line through McDowell and nearby counties in the 1890s and early 1900s. The railroad�s route along Elkhorn Creek to the Tug River at Welch was made possible only by the construction of several tunnels, including Elkhorn Tunnel through Flat Top Mountain (near the Coalsdale community to the east) and West Vivian Tunnel nearby. The town of Kimball was laid out and developed by the Houston Coal Company, and was incorporated in 1911. ,  Prior to the development of the coal industry in southern West Virginia, the area contained only scattered, self-sufficient farms and small communities. Due to the low population and the resulting shortage of labor, the local coal companies were forced to recruit workers from elsewhere, first from the older coalfields in Pennsylvania and then from Eastern and Southern Europe and the American South. Each immigrant group brought its own language and customs to the area, creating the type of ethnic diversity that had previously been found only in the larger cities. To accommodate these new arrivals, the coal companies built self-sufficient communities to house and provide for their workers. By 1920, it is estimated that almost 80% of the coal miners in West Virginia were living in company-owned housing. In many communities the flattest land was occupied by the mining, railroad, and commercial facilities, with the company housing located on the nearby hillslopes. ,  The commercial center of towns such as Kimball was the company store, which was operated both for the convenience of the mine workers and the profit of the coal company. The stores ,  such as the Houston Coal Company Store nearby ,  were typically placed in prominent locations and displayed distinctive architectural features meant to reflect the company�s wealth and position in the community. The stores typically sold a wide variety of merchandise, including food, hardware, clothing, furniture, and appliances that might be difficult to obtain otherwise. The buildings often also housed the local post office, as well as the company�s business, a doctor�s office, and a �clubhouse� to accommodate visitors. Because of their central locations and multiple functions, the stores were also a center for social activity, both during and outside business hours. ,  Most company stores had a scrip system, which involved paper or metal currency that was issued by the coal company and could only be redeemed at the store. Miners had the option of receiving their earnings in cash, but might also draw scrip on or between paydays as an advance against future wages.

Gray Barker graduated from Glenville State College, later teaching English at a Maryland high school before moving to Clarksburg to manage a movie theatre. Mr. Barker eventually established his own business booking movies for local cinemas and drive-ins. In 1953, Barker's first UFO article, \"The Monster and the Saucer,\" was published in <b>Fate</b> magazine, and the rest was history. His first article described the sighting of the Flatwoods Monster, an alien with a spade-shaped head and glowing eyes. Later in '53, Barker published the fist installment of his magazine, \"The Saucerian,\" that focused on UFO sightings and extraterrestrial encounters. In 1956, the magazine's name changed to the Saucerian Bulletin and remained vastly popular through the 1960s.,   Barker's first book, \"They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers,\" was published in 1956. The book dramatized Albert Bender's meeting with three men dressed in black, a meeting that supposedly led to the demise of the International Flying Saucer Bureau. The book was a phenomenal success introducing both Barker and the Men in Black to popular culture. The Men in Black had long been a part of folklore representing evil before Barker presented them as a covert group sent to silence outspoken UFO advocates. \"They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers\" forged Barker's career as a UFO writer. The Oscar winning Men in Black movies released in 1997, 2002, and 2012 starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were spawn of the creative genius of Gray Barker.,   Beginning in 1959, Barker expanded Saucerian Publications, which produced The Saucerian/The Saucerian Bulletin in Clarksburg to include books sales and production. The first book the Saucerian Press produced was Howard Menger's \"From Outer Space to You.\" Saucerian Books also produced and sold works by Morris Jessup, Laura Mundo, and Michael X, all found in the collection. The business also sold overstock books from other publishers serving as a mail order book service for hard-to-find or out-of-print works as noted throughout his personal correspondence, notably the \"C\" files.,   In 1962, Barker sold The Saucerian Bulletin to James Moseley, the editor of <b>Saucer</b> News. Soon afterward, Baker filed for bankruptcy. Barker returned to magazine publication when he replaced Moseley as the chief editor of <b>Saucer</b> News for a brief stint between 1968 and 1970. In 1975, Barker set up another UFO magazine, Gray Barker's Newsletter. The newsletter was produced until April 1984. <b>Saucer</b> New was restarted in 1976 by its long-time editor, James Moseley. The publication is still produced as \"Saucer Smear.\",   In 1970, Barker published his second best well-known book, \"The Silver Bridge,\" in which, Barker regaled readers with the Mothman sightings that took place around Point Pleasant, WV before the collapse of the Silver Bridge in 1966. The movie \"The Mothman Prophecies\" starring Richard Gere was released in 2002 based upon the Barker work. Throughout the 1970's and early 1980's, Barker continued to publish his own works as well as others via the Saucerian Press. In 1983, Barker released \"Men in Black: The Secret Terror Among Us,\" in which he provided readers with additional and updated stories about the men in black.,   In his article \"The Wild Side of Ufology,\" Jerome Clark describes Barker as someone who \"realized early on that the UFO mystery was not likely to be solved by him�[and as such became] a collector of tales, rumors, reports, dreams, and lies�a few describe real events�most, however, are exaggerations, distortions, or unadulterated fantasies.\" Barker delighted in entertainment fact of that could be found among the world of ufology. Barker was a well-known hoaxer among his day. The interesting thing is that Barker's hoaxes have continued to spark debate decades after being debunked. Barker's most well-known hoaxes are the infamous R.E. Straith and the Lost Creek Saucer Sighting.,   The Straith Letter was Barker's most notorious hoax. It was carried out by Barker and good friend, James Moseley in 1957. Using State Department letterhead, they wrote to George Adamski as R.E. Straith claiming that and other department members had evidence supporting Adamski's experiences. While, it is believed that Adamski knew the letter was a fake, he quickly publicized it as evidence supporting his claims. The letter sparked debate over Straith's existence spurring a federal investigation in which Barker and Moseley were both heavily questioned. The letter's origins remained a mystery until after Barker's death in 1984.,   The Lost Creek Saucer sighting was brainstormed by Barker and James Moseley in early 1966. The idea was to produce footage of a flying saucer. On July 26, 1966, they had John Sheets, one of Barker's researchers, hold a ceramic 'boogie' saucer on a fishing pole in front of a car while Moseley drove and Barker filmed. Afterward, Moseley played the film during his UFO lectures, and Barker sold copies of the footage via his mail-order film business. Both men continued to claim that Sheets had innocently recorded the saucer landing. In \"Whispers from Space,\" the footage is shown while Moseley discusses its origins.,   According to his literary colleague and conspirator, John Sherwood, \"The U.S. Government's bibliography of UFO publications reflected Barker's high status among the flying-saucer faithful, as he's among the handful of authors cited more than a dozen times. Here's the dark side: Until Barker's death in 1984 at age 59, he hawked his books and magazines by embellishing stories and encouraging others to fabricate more. He launched hoaxes, joined others' deceptions, and manipulated people's beliefs. And I was one of those who helped.\",   According to Ralph Coon's biography about Barker, \"Whispers from Space\" ,  Barker adored movies and fantasy, dressed as monsters and spacemen to scare kids, held fans at a distance, drank heavily, and sold books chiefly to help his family. further according to Mr. Sherwood, \"Barker's sister Blanch quoted him as having justified his UFO interest financially: \"There's good money in it,\" he'd told her. Moseley said Barker actually \"did not believe in UFOs as an objective entity\" but wanted \"to please his audience\" and tried \"to keep the UFO field active during slack periods.\",   Surreptitiously, James Moseley and Barker had obtained blank U.S. State Department stationery. AFter \"we had a bit to drink\" in 1957, they concocted a message to \"contactee\" George Adamski, whose book Flying Saucers Have Landed had related chats with Christ-like extraterrestrials. Adamski thus received an official-looking letter from \"R.E. Straith\" aiming to \"encourage you work.\" Much of Barker's book on Adamski focused on the letter as \"one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of the UFO field.\",   From 1973-79, Gray Barker resided in Buckhannon, managing the Colonial Theatre that he remodeled and transitioned to the Cinema Theatre. Mr. Barker died on December 6, 1984 in Charleston. As stated on the Clarksburg Harrison Library website, Barker's \"creative writing style inspired a generation of readers to dream about UFOs. His works sparked debates among ufologists and enthusiasts who flourished during the heyday of UFOs. As UFOs fade, from the mainstream American psyche, the value of his works as science fiction will linger for future generations.\",   <b>Dedicated by the City of Buckhannon on the 92nd birthday of Gray Barker</b>"},{"id":178913,"title":"Leonard Mactaggart Pare Lorentz","pos":[38.99422,-80.22882],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=178913","desc":"Leonard Mactaggart \"Pare\" Lorentz. .  ,  On December 11, 1905, in Clarksburg, West Virginia, was born one of the most acclaimed documentarians in American history. Pare Lorentz attended West Virginia Wesleyan College and resided here in Buckhannon during most of his childhood. He later also attended West Virginia University. During his amazing career comprising several decades, Mr. Lorentz went on to become the official documentary filmmaker for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mr. Lorentz's parents, Pare Hanson Lorentz and Alma MacTaggart Ruttencutter Lorentz, moved to Buckhannon when Pare was very young. Pare Lorentz attended Buckhannon schools growing up, and at age 11 enrolled at West Virginia Wesleyan College to take violin lessons. Mr. Lorentz later enrolled as a fulltime student at Wesleyan, taking classes from 1921-23, but interestingly didn't graduate from Buckhannon High School until 1922. While at Wesleyan, he mostly registered for American government courses. Pare Lorentz's biography maintained at the Pare Lorenz Center states that his father was a printer and publisher of high school and college yearbooks while his mother was a professional singer. The Pare Lorentz Center's site offers this interesting passage about his early life. \"There was always music in the Lorentz home, which led to his lifelong love and appreciation of music; young Leonard studied the violin for 10 years.... He played fiddle in an orchestra and was editor of \"Moonshine\" [WVU's humor magazine] and a member of an honorary journalistic fraternity \"Sphinx.\",   Lorentz left WVU before graduation and applied his early writing experience for the newly-launched magazine \"The New Yorker.\" Soon thereafter, Mr. Lorentz adopted his father's first name \"Pare\" for all future publications and projects. In 1925, still not 20 years old, Pare Lorentz was promoted to editor of The Edison Sales Builder. Within the year, he was hired by the popular humor magazine \"Judge\" and shortly thereafter was named as the magazine's motion picture critic. Soon he was writing film criticism for the New York Evening Journal newspaper and magazines including Vanity Fair, Town and Country, and McCall's. Lorentz strongly believed that movies held enormous potential for social justice and education. In 1930 he partnered with attorney Morris Ernst on the book \"Censored: The Private Life of the Movies,\" assessing the importance of early film. In \"Pare Lorentz and the Documentary Film,\" biographer Robert L. Snyder wrote, \"Lorentz was 25 and had been a critic and student of film only two years; yet he clearly revealed a powerful insight into the potential of motion pictures, a potential he was among the first to fulfill in this country.\",   In 1931, Lorentz married actress Sally Bates, successfully conniving newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst to finance his European honeymoon under the pretext that he would interview director Rene Clair in France while also meeting Alfred Hitchcock in England. Rehired later by Hearst Newspapers, Lorentz was dispatched to Washington to write about spies who were rumored to be lurking in the Roosevelt Administration. Pare Lorentz was fascinated by the Roosevelt presidency from its inception. Lorentz authored \"The Roosevelt Year\" that was published in 1934. In 1935, Lorentz met with FDR's Agriculture Secretary, Henry A. Wallace, who introduced him to Rexford Guy Tugwell, Roosevelt's chief of the Resettlement Administration. Tugwell was enthused with Lorentz's film-making ideas, suggesting that they make 18 films. As the initial subject, Lorentz suggested the Dust Bowl. With a very meager $6,000 budget, Lorentz's very first film, \"The Plow that Broke the Plains,\" had him serving as both producer and director. The film premiered on the second floor of the White House in early March of 1936 and this was the first time that Lorentz met the president. When the film finished, FDR was brimming with enthusiasm and praised Lorentz during a long talk with him. The film received excellent press but not wide distribution as many of the larger distributors labeled it as political propaganda.,   Discouraged, Lorentz was on the cusp of quitting government filmmaking, however, later in 1936 undertook \"The River,\" about the Mississippi River. President Roosevelt was greatly impressed, and Lorentz premiered the film in New Orleans and then traveled up and down the Mississippi to promote it. The enormously positive reviews led to national distribution and a highly successful premiere in Great Britain. \"The River\" was entered in the 1938 Venice Film Festival where it received first prize as best documentary becoming the first American film ever to be honored in this category. The success of \"The River\" led to the establishment of the United States Film Service. Lorentz's next major project \"The Fight for Life,\" about infant and maternal mortality in the U.S. was released in 1940. Dr. Walter M. Simpson, chief pathologist of the Miami Valley Hospital for Research wrote to Lorentz, \"Have heard only enthusiastic praise from every good obstetrician. Generally agreed that it will revolutionize obstetric practice, save thousands of lives and help correct social conditions that contributed to present high maternal and infant morbidity rates.\",   Lorentz supervised two other important documentaries, \"The City\" and \"The Land,\" while also creating the radio drama \"Ecce Homo!\" about unemployment, all while working for the U.S. Film Service. Lorentz later served heroically during world war two filming more than 2,500 hours of bombing raids to create 200 briefing films for pilots assigned to fly unfamiliar routes. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. After the war, Lorentz was commissioned by the War Department to create a film version of the Nuremberg Trials for which he spent years editing more than a million hours of harrowing footage of Nazi atrocities, propaganda footage, and footage of the trials themselves. It was one of the first films to extensively document the trials of Nazi leaders after the war. \"Nuremberg: Its Lesson for Today,\" was shown for two years to packed houses in American occupied Germany and other European nations, but oddly and due to changing political tensions was not shown in the U.S. until 1979, despite Lorentz's vehement protests. Lorentz produced one final film, \"Rural Co-op,\" in 1947 about farmers in Rockingham County, Virginia before he retired from public life.,   Records show that Lorentz had several other ideas for documentary films, but he was never able to obtain the necessary funding to make them. He remained politically active and in 1955 served as the Washington Post's special correspondent to the First United Nationals Conference on the Peaceful Uses of the Atom. In 1960 he authored with environmentalist Rachel Carson, the Democratic National Committee's pollution platform. He also continued to work as a film consultant on various projects and taught at several universities and schools. Among his many special honors and awards was the Doctor of Letters bestowed upon him by West Virginia Wesleyan College in 1972, the Doctor of Humanities by West Virginia University in 1978, and the Lifetime Achievement Award presented posthumously by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History in 1990.,   Pare Lorentz died in Armonk, New York, on March 4, 1992 at the age of 86. Mr. Lorentz and his first wife, Sally had two children, Pare Lorentz, Jr., and Matilda Lorentz Grey. His first marriage ended in divorce and he married again in 1943 to Elizabeth Meyer who also had been an employee with the U.S. Film Service. Pare Lorentz visited what he regarded as his home of Buckhannon on many occasions. This placard is installed as a permanent tribute to one of the greatest filmmakers and documentarians in U.S. history who grew up in Buckhannon and once traversed this very street and perhaps took in a film or two at our own Colonial Theatre.

Harper (1889-1977). He was one of three children, who with sisters, Ruth and Reta, grew up on the family farm just a few miles south of Buckhannon. Inspired by our area's natural beauty and nature's grandeur, Mr. Harper developed an early love for wildlife and art, ultimately recognized as one of the most acclaimed and internationally renowned, American, modernist and naturalist artists. Harper's illustrious career in art began right here. During his student days at West Virginia Wesleyan College, Harper served as the Art Director for Wesleyan's 1940 edition of the yearbook, the <i>Murmurmontis</i>, a significant yearbook that then celebrated our college's golden anniversary. Charley Harper was drafted and served as a reconnaissance scout in the U.S. Army during World War II. Using ink and watercolor to document stark scenes of war-torn Europe, including bombed-out churches, cities and battlefields, Harper's art during world war two included his self-portrait as an army scout and anti-war cartoons. His son, Brett Harper, observed following his father's passing, \"On an emotional level, I am continually moved by the photos of 'Stroll Into Oblivion' and its visceral portrayal of one element of war's collateral damage, i.e., orphaned, displaced children.\",   After leaving West Virginia, Harper studied at the Art Academy of Cincinnati. He met his wife, Edie McKee Harper (1922-2010), also a renowned artist, at the Art Academy. Charley and Edie were married for 60 years. Charley and Edie spent their honeymoon traveling the country, mainly in the west and south, being able to do so because of the Stephen H. Wilder Scholarship the Academy awarded to Charley for post-graduate travels. Charley Harper returned to the Art Academy of Cincinnati as a teacher and also worked for a commercial art studio before working on his own. He and his wife worked out of their Roselawn and Finneytown homes, and later, with their only child Brett Harper, formed Harper Studios.,   Charley Harper was best known as an illustrator, notably for his work in <i>Ford Times</i> magazine, and in books including <i>The Golden Book of Biology</i> for children. He also created works for the National Park Service, the Cincinnati Zoo, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Everglades National Park, Hawk Mountain Sanctuary, and the Michigan Audubon Society among many others. His works were featured in Betty Crocker's cookbook.,   In a style he called \"minimal realism,\" Charley Harper captured the essence of his subjects with the fewest possible, visual elements. There was a rare and delightful playfulness in Harper's artwork. When asked to describe his unique visual style, Charley responded: \"When I look at a wildlife or nature subject, I don't see the feathers in the wings, I just count the wings. I see exciting shapes, color combinations, patterns, textures, fascinating behavior and endless possibilities for making interesting pictures. I regard the picture as an ecosystem in which all the elements are interrelated, interdependent, perfectly balanced; and herein lies the lure of painting: in a world of chaos, the picture is one small rectangle in which the artist can create an ordered universe.\",   \"I tried to start off like a good artist-naturalist should, by doing my field work,\" said Charley Harper, probably the only wildlife artist in America who has never been compared to Audubon. \"But by the time I had aimed and focused the binoculars, the bird was long gone. I could never get close enough to count the feathers in the wings, so I just count the wings. I can get the birds in my binoculars now, but the more I learn about nature, the more I have to ask myself: Can a nature lover ever find true happiness at the top of the food chain?\",   Renowned designer, Todd Oldham described Charley Harper's work as \"a marvel, brilliant in a way I had never seen before,\" possessing a \"lyrically joyous style\" with \"a remarkable and exquisite color sense\" adding 'Charley's inspired yet accurate color sense is undeniable, and when combined with the precision he exacts on rendering only the most important details, one is always left with a sense of awe.\" Charley Harper received much recognition and many awards during his long and amazing career in the arts. December 8, 2006, was proclaimed by Cincinnati's mayor as Charley Harper Day. In 2003, the Sharonville Fine Arts Council awarded Harper a Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2007, an exhibition of the Harpers' early work was held at the Cincinnati Art Museum. Shortly prior to his death, the Cornell Ornithology Lab commissioned Mr. Harper to undertake a painting to celebrate the Lab's relationship with birds. In 2011, the first exhibition of Harper's works in Germany took place at Kunstverein Hamburg.,   Charley Harper died in Cincinnati on June 10, 2007 at the age of 84. He was survived by his beloved wife, Edie, who died in 2010, and his son, Brett. Mr. Harper's remains were interred in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.

However in 1984, a fire swept through this block of Main Street, destroying most of the buildings including the one that stood here. Following the fire, C.E. Mylius built the structure you see here today. There is a long list of businesses and enterprises that have been located at this building, starting with Simon Levinstein. Simon was born in western Russia in 1873, immigrated to America 1889, landing in the port of Baltimore at the age of 15. He earned a living as a peddler, traveling up and down the towns along the rivers with a pack on his back.

Child labor was common in West Virginia during the hand loading era, which took place from the onset of coal mining in the 19th century until around 1930. Mining was a skilled craft, and it took a number of years to learn. A young miner usually picked up skills by going down into the mine with his father or an uncle. This was on a part-time basis, perhaps on Saturday at first, then during summer vacation. As he grew older, he spent more time in the mine and less time in school until the day he was strong and skilled enough to enter the mine on his own. ,  Boys who worked beside their fathers were not paid a wage by the company or even counted as an employee. Instead, they were given an allowance by their fathers from his wage, which in 1910 was about 40 cents for each ton mined. When his father deemed him ready, the boy might be given an independent job. Many held the job of �trapper boy,� in which he would be responsible for opening and shutting the wooden, hinged ventilation doors to allow for the passage of coal cars. A typical wage in 1910 was about one dollar per day for this job. ,  Boys in their teens with more experience were given difficult and hazardous jobs associated with the haulage of coal inside the mine. In the days before electric or battery-powered motors, mules or horses were used to pull trains of mine cars to the outside. Teenage boys were employed as mule drivers, with all of the difficulties of handling the stubborn animals in the dark environment. ,  Perhaps the most hazardous job in the mines for a worker of any age was �spragging.� Since the early mine cars had no brakes, the only way to slow or stop a car flying down the haulage entry was to thrust a sprag (a short, round piece of wood tapered at each end) between the spokes of the mine car wheel. Spraggers had to race along side the moving trains of cars, dodging obstructions and ducking low top to perform their jobs. They risked the amputation of fingers and hands, and could be run over by a speeding coal car. At various times, legislation was passed to regulate child labor. In 1887, the state legislature passed an act prohibiting any minor, under twelve years of age, to work in any factory workshop, or mine. In 1907, the minimum age was raised to fourteen and females of any age were banned from mine labor. All that was required for a child to obtain work was an affidavit stating that the applicant was beyond the age limit of fourteen. Fathers of the young boys were primarily responsible for submitting the affidavit. Employers, eager to get cheap labor, sometimes looked the other way. ,  In 1919, a law was enacted requiring all minors to undergo a complete physical examination from a public health physician in order to acquire a work permit to take a lob in a mine or factory. The new law, which was hailed as one of the most progressive in the nation, also required completion of a sixth grade education prior to acquisition of a work permit and prohibited any child of sixteen or younger from working more than eight hours a day. ,  Regardless of the legislation, children continued to work in the southern West Virginia mines through the 1930s. From a sample of about 1,000 miners working during the early 1930s, over forty-three percent started in the mines before they were seventeen; nearly sixteen percent began their mining careers between the ages of ten and fourteen; and two percent went into the mines before they were ten years old. ,  <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  Interviewed in the early 1930s, one southern West Virginia miner stated: �I started to work in the mines with my father when I was ten years old. Later, I got a job as a trap boy. I worked in the summer and went to school some in the winter. I lived all my life in a mining camp, didn�t know anything else."},{"id":178968,"title":"Ashland Coal and Coke","pos":[37.40883,-81.35384],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=178968","desc":"Ashland Coal and Coke. . Like so many of the mining companies in the Pocahontas field, Ashland Coal and Coke Company was organized by men from the Pennsylvania anthracite region. Several of the original stockholders were from Ashland, Pennsylvania, and for this reason, the company, mine, settlement, and post office were given its name, Most of Ashland�s leading stockholders and officers retained their interests and residences in Pennsylvania and operated the mines at Ashland as absentees. The leading stockholder and first president of the company, W.J. Richards, remained in Schuylkill County, where he served as President of the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company. ,  Ashland Coal and Coke was incorporated in 1892. A lease was obtained from the Flat Top Land Association on March 18, 1893, and the mine was opened with a wooden gravity-feed tipple to load the coal into hopper cars of the Norfolk and Western Railway. The mine was a simple drift, since the coal seam, Pocahontas No. 3, outcropped along the hillside at five feet, ten inches thick. The mine produced more than 30,000 tons of semi bituminous �smokeless� coal in 1894, its first full year of production. By 1935, total tonnage from the mine hit four million tons ,  all of it hand loaded. The coal seam played out by the late 1970s and the company ceased operations in 1980. ,  <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  Coal companies developed mines in the most practical way to extract the coal. When a coal seam was exposed along a hillside, a simple drift mine was created, this type of mine has a horizontal entry into the coal seam. As the coal was brought out of the mine, each car was weighed and dumped. From this point it was moved, usually by conveyor belt to a processing building (preparation plant), where it was sorted and sized, then transported to the tipple and loaded into railroad cars."},{"id":178969,"title":"Stockert Building / People's Grocery & Home Hardware","pos":[38.99406,-80.22878],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=178969","desc":"Stockert Building, also, People's Grocery and Home Hardware. .  ,  <b>Stockert Building</b> ,  The largest commercial building on Main Street was built in 1908 for T.L.

Ashland.  ,  Ashland is located along the North Fork of Elkhorn Creek, one of the most heavily developed coal regions in the Pocahontas field. At its height, the North Fork valley held an estimated ten thousand people, some of whom worked for the Ashland Coal and Coke Company.,  The tipple of the company mine was demolished in the 1980s and all that remains, from its nearly one hundred years of operation, is the company store and a few company houses. A <i>Bluefield Daily Telegraph</i> article, dated December 21, 1904 described the original company store, the Ashland Commissary, as a �fine structure.� The three-story building (including basement) was heated by steam throughout, and featured marble tops on the counters and a large cold storage room that held over a carload of ice and an �enormous supply� of perishable goods. The cost of the entire structure was between twelve and thirteen thousand dollars. ,  Nearly five hundred company towns were built between 1890 and 1930 in the southern West Virginia coalfield, with about one hundred in the Pocahontas field alone. Due to isolation from commercial centers, coal companies had to supply all of the goods and services that their employees required. The company store was essential. ,  The store was generally in a central location within the company town, commonly located in a flat area along the railroad tracks, accessible from both the mine and homes. The store�s stock ranged from groceries and dry goods to furniture, cook stoves, clothing and mining supplies, including shovels, picks, powder, fuses, caps, calcium carbide (for lighting inside the mine), and coveralls. Trying to cover all needs, cradles were sold as well as coffins. ,  The company store was the business center of the community. Company offices were often located within the building, with valuable records, cash, and scrip housed in a massive vault. Acting as a community bank miners received their bi-monthly pay or an advance of scrip at its payroll window on the first floor. Many company stores had clubhouses or boarding rooms upstairs to serve as hostelries for visiting company officials or dignitaries. Often, the store was the community�s hospital or clinic, since the office of the company doctor was frequently located in the building. In many communities, communications passed through the company store, since it was usually the site of the post office. ,  The public life in the community centered around the store. Women often shopped in the morning and the men turned up after work. Children came and went according to their own schedules. During times with no work at the mine, townspeople of all ages might be found at the store. The company store, with its broad porch, was custom-made for awaiting the mail train or for holiday celebrations. ,  The company store, along with the company town, declined in importance during the 1930s as hard roads and automobiles allowed miners to travel to and shop in the incorporated towns. The company store lasted longer in southern West Virginia than elsewhere, with some stores staying open for business through the 1950s and 1960s. ,  <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  An edited version of an article that ran in the Bluefield newspaper describing the opening of the new company store.<blockquote><b>Bluefield Daily Telegraph</b>, Wednesday Morning, December 21, 1904 ,  The Ashland Coal and Coke Company, located at Ashland, can be justly proud of their new commissary, which is undoubtedly a fine structure, fitted with all the modern appliances that make such a place convenient and up to date.

Throughout much of the history of mining, miners have been hampered in their efforts to earn a living wage by the lack of steady work. In the years prior to the 1930s, when unionization and mechanization of loading began to change the industry, the problem was intermittent work. ,  During the period from 1890 to 1930, the coal mines of the nation were operated only two-thirds of full time. This was partly due to strikes and lockouts, a result of periodic clashes between the coal operators and the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). The main cause of idleness was the lack of market demand for coal. By 1910 the industry as a whole had reached a state of overexpansion and the potential supply of coal was greater than the nation could consume. Lacking orders for their coal or the railroad cars to ship it, coal operators were forced to shut down periodically, resulting in lost wages for miners. ,  Southern West Virginia�s miners were somewhat more fortunate. However, the lack of demand for their product and the lack of railroad cars still existed. At this time, the activities of the UMWA were restricted in the region, resulting in fewer work stoppages due to strikes and lockouts. They worked on average 231 days during this period. Some years were better than others. During the World War I period, when coal was in great demand, miners worked nearly full time, but during the 1920s anti 1930s, when overexpansion became more pronounced, miners were idle nearly as much as they were on the job. For example, in 1921, West Virginia�s miners worked only an average of 149 days, slightly less than half time. ,  The next threat to coal miners� livelihoods came with mechanization. The first cutting machines were introduced in the 1890s, but the full force of mechanization came with the installation of loading machines in the 1930s and 1940s, then the introduction of continuous milling in the 1950s and 1960s. As a result, thousands of miners lost their jobs to machines. The impact of this widespread unemployment was more sorely felt in southern West Virginia than in other part of the nation. ,   The impact of mechanization on employment in southern West Virginia was felt first by black coal miners, who made up nearly one-third of the total mining labor force. Loading machines, with the Joy loader as the industry standard, rapidly displaced black miners during the 1930s and 1940s. One black miner recalled that the mine management �always put them (loading machines) where blacks were working first.� �Black men,� he said, �could not kick against the machine.� Many black miners and their families left the region. By 1980, the number of black miners in the state had declined by over 90 percent. ,  After reaching a peak of 125,000 miners in 1947, employment in the state plummeted to 65,000 by 1954, and then to 49,000 in 1960. Widespread unemployment decimated mining communities in southern West Virginia. Coal companies abandoned their towns as thousands of miners unable to find work in the coalfields left to find manufacturing jobs in Ohio or Michigan. ,  <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  After organizing nearly all of the nation�s miners under its banner in 1933, the miners� union agreed to support mechanization in return for a share of the benefits from increased productivity, including higher wages, a seniority system to protect jobs, and eventually, a welfare and retirement fund to provide cradle to grave care for miners and their families. John L. Lewis, President of the UMWA, realized that mechanization would result in the loss of thousands of mining jobs, but saw it as the only way to solve the industry�s chronic problem of overexpansion. ,  <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  Tell me, what will a coal miner do? ,  Tell me, what will a coal miner do? ,  When he goes down in the mine, ,  Joy loaders he will find. ,  Tell me, what will a coal miner do? ,       <i>, �The Coal Loading Machine,� by George Korson</i>"},{"id":178976,"title":"The Lurch Bench","pos":[38.9941,-80.22987],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=178976","desc":"The Lurch Bench.

On Halloween of 1965, Ted appeared on Shindig, another musical, variety show with Boris Karloff performing \"The Monster Mash.\" His deep \"Basso Profundo\" resulted ini his being featured in dozens of cartoons particularly with Hanna-Barbera studios, including as \"Metallus\" on \"Space Ghost\" and \"The Thing\" on \"The Fantastic Four,\" and \"Brainiac\" and \"The Black Manta\" on \"Challenge of the Superfriends.\" Ted Cassidy's distinctive, iconic tone made him one of the most famous and recognizable voices in American history. In a 1978 interview given shortly before his death, Ted Cassidy state:,   <blockquote><i> \"If I'm up for a part if, I'm asked to do something, I really worry what I'm going to be because they always make fellows like me the big dumb galoot, the oaf who doesn't know anything, who trips over himself. We are apparently idiots, all big men. You end up never leading anyone to anything. You end up holding people, while the boss hits them in the face -- scratching your head a lot wondering where all your marbles went. Well that kind of thing doesn't appeal to me at all. I used to think that's how it was and I would do it, but I won't do it anymore. I turn down everything that comes along like that. So, the only thing you can rely on are those who have worked with you and know that you are consistent, talented and reliable, and maybe they're friends of yours and are willing to put you to work so you don't end up in the welfare line.\" </blockquote></i> ,   In June of 1966, Mr. Cassidy returned to Buckhannon serving as the Grand Marshall of the silver anniversary ofo our WV Strawberry Festival (photo above). He left us way too early dying in Los Angeles on January 16, 1979, survived by his son Sean, and daughter Cameron.,   We now honor and will forever remember the beloved, gentle giant of a man who preached against bullying before it was fashionable, and who once walked among us here on our streets of Buckhannon."},{"id":178977,"title":"Veterans Memorial","pos":[39.48118,-79.0478],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=178977","desc":"Veterans Memorial. .

From the perspective of the coal company, the company store had a vital economic function. In an age when sixty percent of the mine�s cost of production consisted of wages, it ensured that the flow of money was circular. Miners� wages flowed directly back to the Company�s coffers in the form of payment for goods and rent for company houses. This form of secondary economic exploitation of the work force was of importance to company balance sheets, particularly in hard times and for smaller firms. ,  To further reduce outlays of cash, companies issued their own currency ,  scrip ,  which was redeemable at the company store. Scrip came in a variety of forms and denominations. Some companies issued paper scrip, which resembled currency and was printed with a monetary value, the company name and the store location. More common was metal scrip, which was made from a variety of materials ,  aluminum, brass, bronze, copper, nickel and nickel silver. ,  In the earliest days of mining, some companies actually paid miners with scrip instead of cash, but this practice was outlawed in 1887. State law then required payment in legal tender and at two-week intervals. Scrip was issued to miners in advance of payday at their request to tide them over, but only if the miner had pay due him. At payday the value of the scrip was deducted from the miner's earnings. ,  There was also something of a \"black market\" for scrip in which it could be traded for cash at a discount of up to forty percent. In an effort to provide a higher standard of living for their families, or simply to obtain the tools required for their jobs, some miners drew their entire earnings in scrip and found themselves �owing their soul to the company store,� at least according to the lyrics of a popular song of the 1950s. This was more common during hard times, especially during the Great Depression. ,  <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  During the first half of the 19th century, banks and companies often issued their own money. As the nation was growing rapidly, U.S. currency and coin were not always readily available. The issuing of scrip by a coal company accomplished several things. Most importantly. It provided a means for the company to preserve cash. After all, the coal company had to deal with the outside world to buy equipment and supplies that required real currency. Secondly, scrip was an accounting device that provided the miner with a clear picture of his working balance. However, by accepting scrip instead of cash, the miners were, in fact, extending credit to the company. For the miner, he could request scrip as an advance against his future wages ,  basically, an interest free loan to the miner. On payday, the miner would be paid in cash or could request scrip instead. ,  Mining communities were dry ,  no liquor was sold in the company stores. Having scrip made it more difficult for a miner to buy liquor ,  he would have to either cell his scrip for cash or deal with a merchant who would take the scrip, at a high discount in value. This was thought to discourage the purchase of liquor."},{"id":178989,"title":"Veterans Memorial","pos":[39.50226,-80.16543],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=178989","desc":"Veterans Memorial. .

In all probability no record was ever made of the first visit. It is well known that adventurers always push into new countries in advance of organized exploring parties: and it is likely that such was the case with West Virginia when that was only an unnamed wilderness. Probably the indians, who waged war with the early colonists of Virginia carried prisoners into this region on their hunting excursions. Sixty-five years were required for colonists of Virginia to become superficially acquainted with the country as far west as the Blue Ridge, which, until June, 1670, was the outer limit of explorations in that direction. The distance from Jamestown, the first colony, to the base of the Blue Ridge was two hundred miles. Nearly three-quarters of a century was required to push the outposts of civilization two hundred miles, and that, too, across a country favorable for exploration, and with little danger from Indians during most of the time. In later years the outposts of civilization moved westward at an average yearly rate of seventeen miles. The people of Virginia were not satisfied to allow the Blue Ridge to remain the boundary between the known and unknown countries; and in 1670, sixty-three years after the first settlement in the State, the Governor of Virginia sent out an exploring party under Captain Henry Battle, with instructions to cross the mountains of the west, seek for silver and gold, and try to discover a river flowing into the Pacific Ocean. Early in June of that year, 1670, the explorers forced the heights of the Blue Ridge which they found steep and rocky, and descended into the valley west of that range. They discovered a river flowing due north. The observations and measurements made by these explorers perhaps satisfied the royal Governor who sent them out; but their accuracy may be questioned. They reported that the river which they had discovered was four hundred and fifty yards wide; its banks in most places one thousand yards high. Beyond the river they said they could see towering mountains destitute of trees, and crowned by white cliffs, hidden much of the time in mist, but occasionally clearing sufficiently to give a glimpse of their ruggedness. They expressed the opinion that those unexplored mountains might contain silver and gold. They made no attempt to cross the river, but set out on their return. From their account of the broad river and its banks thousands of feet high, one might suppose that they had discovered the canyon of the Colorado; but it was only New River, the principle tributary of the Kanawha. The net year, 1671, the Governor of Virginia sent explorers to continue the work, and they remained a considerable time in the valley of New River. If they penetrated as far as the present territory of West Virginia, which is uncertain, they probably crossed the line into what is now Monroe or Mercer Counties. ,   <center><b><i>From</i> History of Upshur County <i>by</i> W.B. Cutright</b>.  ,   <b>8 East Main Street</b> ,  Prior to 1880, a large wood frame home stood at this site, taking up the entire corner of North Kanawha and Main Street. Originally owned by Alvin M. Bastable, he sold it to Jacob Lorentz in 1857. Jacob passed the property on to his daughter, Ruhanna Poundstone who held title until 1880 when the property was purchased by G.A. Newlon. The Newlon family sold the home in 1882 to Jerome B. Morrison who owned it for one year before selling to L.P. and Ida M. Shinn. Mr. Shinn was a successful businessman, and in the late 1880's he tore down the home and constructed three 2-story commercial wood-frame structures shown in the picture below. In 1900, this property was purchased by H.S. Stockert and in 1911 he tore down the wood frame structure and built the 3-story brick building you see here today. One of the most famous businesses to be located here, was G.O. Young Drug Store which opened here in 1911.,   The G.O. Young Drug Store was the grandest drug store and soda fountain in the state of West Virginia when it opened. It boasted having the largest electric sign between Washington, D.C. and Chicago. The exquisite interior highlighted mahogany millwork, marble counters and art glass light fixtures, most of which was manufactured by the C.H. Banks Company of Boston. In addition to the retail drug store and soda fountain on the 1st floor, Mr. Young manufactured his famous homemade ice cream in the basement, operated a wholesale book store on the 2nd floor and manufactured patent drugs on the 3rd floor, which he distributed around the state via the railroad. There was a service elevator that moved products from floor to floor. In 1946, Mr. Young sold the business became the Baxa/Young Drug Store and operated until 1951 when the business was sold to John Miller, his son John, operates the pharmacy to this day.,   <b>Strawberry Festival 1936</b> ,  Dr. J.E. Judson, a Biology Professor at West Virginia Wesleyan College, wanted to showcase the wonderful strawberries that were being grown in the central part of West Virginia. Dr. Judson, knew the climate and soil in WV was ideal for growing strawberries and suggested that a celebration be held to draw attention to the growing, preserving, and marketing of the strawberries raised in the central part of West Virginia. Soon after Judson's talk, the Central West Virginia Strawberry Association was organized by the Buckhannon Lions Club and the first Strawberry Festival was planned. The first Strawberry Festival was held just weeks later on Wednesday, June 3, 1936, with strawberry exhibits and the coronation by Governor Kump of Queen Laura Jean Watson on the courthouse steps. More than 6,000 spectators attended the festivities, which also included a grand parade of 30 princesses down Main Street followed by a ball field in Whitescarver Hall, a local ballroom.,   Over the next six years, the Strawberry Festival grew to include a pageant, children's parade, grand parade, air show, marble tournament, and fiddlers contest. Documentary color films of the 1938, 1939, and 1940 festivals are held by the Upshur County Historical Society. In 1943, with World War II raging in Europe and the Pacific, it was decided to discontinue the festival. It was not reestablished until 1949, although the production of strawberries was still promoted during the war years.,   Every year since then, community volunteers plan a week long family friendly celebration, held in late May, that showcases the many artistic and musical talents our region has to offer.

The county instead was mourning the greatest calamity that would befall Upshur in the Civil War--a raid at the Centerville (Rock Cave) and the capture of 70 men, seven of whom would escape, 25 would be paroled and the rest, 43 men, would die at Richmond, Camp Sumter, Salisbury, Wheeling, Andersonville, Ga., and Charleston S.C.,   Even harder to understand was the fact that some of the Rebel raiders were known to the citizens of the community proving now in the third winter of the war between brothers, bitterness had replaced honor.,   As has been recorded previously, Col. A.C. Moore, commanding officer of the Upshur Battery which faced the enemy even before it was mustered into the service, also organized the Upshur County Militia, a body of Home Guards at Buckhannon, August 8, 1862. The known roster of the militia stood at 70. The militia had been subscribed and had volunteered for this type of military service. Daniel Gould was elected commander and given the rank of captain. He was paroled at Charleston, S.C., and arrived home December 29, 1864. Harvey Geyer was named lieutenant. He arrived home April 3, 1864. Loyal McAvoy was duty sergeant and was con-scripted in Richmond, deserted and arrived home December 19, 1863.,   As was the case in every soldier's life, only a comparatively small portion of time in the service was spent in actual combat. The day was spent filling the roster, taking the oath of allegiance, learning basic drill, listening to lectures on military tactics and their duties and future obligations. Then after drawing rations, the next muster date was set at Centerville with orders to go into camp there for a period of basic training. The stationing of the militia at Centerville had two major purposes: one was the strategic location of the town at the point where the Buckhannon Pike, one of the main routes to the south, crossed the Hacker Valley Road running east and west.,   At that time Centerville was one of the leading centers in the southern part of the county. It boasted three general stores stores that were stocked with merchandise to fill every want and demand of the surrounding area, and \"traded\" merchandise for any marketable product the rural farmer and family could produce. There were, also, two blacksmith shops, a gunsmith, a school, two churches, the post office and a tan yard. Second, a fortification already existed on a high hill to the southwest overlooking the town, surrounding roads and country-side erected by soldiers detached from General Rosencrans' army. This hill, known as Fortification Hill, is now part of the farm of Cecil Mearns and his house stands on the location of the fort. This sturdy structure was built of logs cut from the woods nearby and stood upright with one end securely buried in the ground and close together to form a solid wall or barricade for protection and cover during an attack. Trenches were dug around the outside and breastworks of stone were erected. This enclosure was adequate to quarter the militia, the store of ammunition however small, their rifles and equipment. At the base of this hill, to the east, lay the drill field, a large level open piece of ground, now part of the lot the Rock Cave School occupies. It was here the militia went into camp for basic training; learning to drill, handle rifles, do picket duty, military tactics, and the discipline of a soldier. Their rations were issued daily by the federal government.,   The number of rifles issued by the government was not sufficient to go around so a militia man often improvised or used one of his own. Only the pickets used loaded rifles and were always posted to guard all the roads leading into the town. The remainder of the militia drilled with empty rifles except on \"target day\" when live ammunition was used.,   After approximately six weeks, the militia having become familiar with their military duties, the camping period came to an end with a small detail being retained to guard the fortification and equipment, the remainder of the men were ordered to break camp and to muster but once a week at the drill field. Saturday was usually set as \"muster day\" and militiamen's families often accompanied them to spend the day trading at the stores, visiting friends and relatives and attending to business matters.,   One member of the militia, J.C. Eagle, because of jealousy or contempt, became dissatisfied, deserted, fled south into Dixie and joined the Confederate cause. Eagle was frequently used as a scout or guide during the many raids Imboden and his men made through this part of the state. It was on one of these raids that, by an odd turn of fate, the Upshur County Militia was captured.,   The Confederates had learned of a detachment of Union soldiers of Co. E., 10th West Virginia Infantry, of Upshur County, commanded by Captain Moore doing outpost duty under General Milroy, whose headquarters were at Clarksburg, camped near Bulltown and dispatched a force under the command of Major Kesler, large enough to capture or rout them. But, on arriving in Bulltown they learned, to their dismay, that Captain Moore and his troops had been recalled to Clarksburg. This was a disappointment, of course, to the Confederate commander who immediately began casting about another objective. Here, Eagle being one of the Rebel scouts, suggested going further north to capture the militia at Centerville. After learning all the minute details and habits of the militia, furnished very readily by Eagle, a former member, preparations were made to march north and try to turn this visit into a success. Their route of march took them north along the Little Kanawha River and as they passed through Fidler's Mill on the evening of the day before they arrived at Centerville, William \"Uncle Bill\" Fidler, out driving in cows that had strayed in the woods, saw the Confederates pass and recognized several of the men as men of the Upshur area.,   Early on the morning of Saturday, September 12, 1863, Major Kesler and his force arrived unobserved at Centerville under cover of the dense woods and occupied a position on a high hill southeast of the town and overlooking their objective. Here they awaited the early preparations of the militia to muster, and formed their plan of attack.,   The morning was clear and crisp with the first hint of fall in the air. Most of the militia were present at roll call except, strangely enough, George Eagle and Henry Eagle, father and brother of the deserter, J.C. Eagle. (Perhaps not so strange, as it is obvious that the father and son had been warned and it is to their discredit that the militia was not warned and on their shoulders would rest the guilt of 43 deaths).,   Rifles were drawn and the pickets prepared to take up their separate posts about the town. The drill sergeant, Loyal McAvon, prepared to put his men through their formations, unaware of the danger surrounding them. The families of the militiamen that had accompanied them were preparing to spend an enjoyable day trading, watching movements of the militia and visiting friends. Young boys, as usual, were on hand to experience all the excitement of seeing men at drill and to feel the thrill of war in the air.,   Meanwhile Major Kresler had formulated his plan of attack. His tactics were simply flanking movements and just before the pickets of the militia reached their posts, a part of his command circled to the north under cover of the woods and took up a position there on a low knoll closer to the drilling militia. Another force flanked to the south of their objective and concealed by the wooded area, was able to take up a strong position on the high hill alongside the cemetery. This was a very important position as it commanded an excellent approach to the rear of the fortification and thus shut off any sudden movement of the militia in that direction.,   The militia was first fired upon by the Confederate to the north as they advanced and demanded surrender. This surprise attack caused instant confusion among the ranks of the drilling militia. Captain Gould instantly realized the critical position his men were in, an open drill field without cover, his men with empty rifles and the confusion of surprise left little chance for a successful defense.,   An attempt was made by Preston Curry whose horse was tied close to the drill field, to dash for the fortification and secure ammunition, but the advancing Confederates from that direction set fire to the structure thus defeating this heroic attempt.,   Some of the militia were attempting to find cover in the break surrounding woods. Amos Samples was one of the first to break for cover and instantly drew the Confederate fire. He was cut down by a rifle ball in his left leg, and thus became the first casualty.,   (It has been related that the Confederates firing at Samples mistook him for Cyrus Brake, whom they disliked because he had shot one of their men while on a raid through his farm).,   The safest road of escape lay to the northwest through a thick stand of white oak timber and four of the militia, Gideon Wilson, James and Maddison Donly, and Harvey Armstrong, made a dash for freedom in this direction. Although they drew the Confederate fire they ran a zig zag course through the timber and made good their escape with no more damage than a slight wound in Harvey Armstrong's neck made by a minie ball.,   Captain Gould, still attempting to get the men in some form of organization, was met with failure as two more of the militia, John Vincent and George Armstrong, were wounded (four wounded now). Thus realizing the hopelessness of attempting any resistance, Captain Gould had no other choice but to accept the demands of Major Kresler and surrendered the militia--without firing a shot.,   The Confederates closed in from all positions and quickly took command. The arms and ammunition were collected and the men formed in a marching formation. The militiamen who were wounded were immediately taken to town and given attention. Samples was in the worst condition; it was evident his leg was beyond repair so it was amputated by Dr. W.H. Curry without aid of an anesthetic or proper surgical tools, in a small office in the rear of his house.,   That evening the excitement and confusion in the quiet little town of Centerville (Rock Cave) was at a high pitch, the captured militia was prepared to march away. The families of the men were busy saying goodbye and tears and prayers were mingled in open display. After confiscating all horses and anything else available of any value, the Rebel commander issued the order to march. The long line of militiamen moved out of Centerville by the Hacker Valley Road toward the prisons of the South as smoke from the burning fortification hung low and foreboding over the sorrowing town.,   The first night was spent in a church at Cleveland, Webster County. The next morning the Reb soldiers killed a beef from a local farmer's herd and secured roasting ears from a cornfield. This was given to the captured men and they were told to cook their own meal. This was their first lesson in foraging in the field.,   The militia was then marched on southward and it was during one of the night marches near Webster Springs that Isaac Vincent, grandfather of Assessor Earl B. Sayre, made his escape by falling to the ground under the thick laurel that grew along the path, lying still until the marching men were well out of hearing. The remainder of the men were marched on to Richmond, Va., and there entered Old Castle Thunder Prison.,   Before the war was over there would be left behind 27 widows and 83 children.,   The entire state of what is now West Virginia was thrown into panic by the raid on Centerville. In Wheeling, the following editorial appeared in the daily newspaper: \"When will West Virginia have protection? She has given, according to her population, more volunteers to fight the cause, than any other state in the Union, and yet is to be destroyed for want of protection. It is not high time the government should know that West Virginia is virtually without any protection? Surely the government cannot be fully appraised of our situation, or else it would not suffer these things to be. We have all confidence in the general government that it will crush the rebellion--but certainly the powers that be at Washington do not know of our true condition in West Virginia\".,   Thomas W. Gawthrop recorded that the Upshur Militia was marched to Big Springs, beyond Cleveland, to the court-house at Warm Springs and to Milborough depot where the men were put on trains for Staunton and the next day landed at Old Castle Thunder. There the men were put up in the walls of a large brick pen with no cover. Gawthrop, as was the case with most men, wore only thin summer clothing. He received a very severe cold due to exposure and soon developed a dreadful cough which hampered his sleep.,   A few days after the arrival of the Upshur men, the Richmond Enquirer, a daily newspaper of the time, reported the capture and raid in Upshur County. Seeing Gawthrop's name in the published list, three friends arrived at the prison and pledged themselves to help in securing releases on parole, if possible. These men were Hon. E.J. Armstrong, C.W. Newlon and Lawyer James Neson.,   Due to the fact that some of the Upshur Militiamen had been bushwhackers and had killed some of the Rebs in the course of the war, parole was denied. Gawthrop then asked for an exchange, but this failed, and meantime he became so, weak he doubted if he could live ten days longer, but Gawthrop refused to be sent to a hospital.,   Finally one of the three friends from Richmond advised Gawthrop to seek escape from his prison by being allowed to be conscripted into the Rebel military service. Twenty of the Upshur Militia were taken out on the recommendation of friends for conscript, but when Major Berkley issued guns, ten refused, and they were put in a guardhouse for a week.,   AFter the week had elapsed, the 20 were brought in line again and told that those who refused guns would be sent back to prison. The 20 refused and were consequently imprisoned although four were exempted from military duties--two tanners, one blacksmith and one shoemaker. Gawthrop remained as a shoemaker offering his own boots as testimonial of his workmanship.,   When General Meade was crowding Lee at Fredericksburg part of the militia was marched to Richmond on November 29, 1863, and there took a train for Hanover Junction, 25 miles distant, where the group awaited further orders. It was here during the night that Gawthrop awoke with a strong impression that God had opened the way for the four men to go home.,   At daylight, the men drew three days' rations. On Tuesday, December 1, three days' more rations were cooked and at moonrise, Gawthrop and four companions bid the camp a silent farewell.,   Gawthrop arrived home December 19, 1863 on a Saturday night, rested Sunday and on Monday traveled into Buckhannon to report the condition of his fellow prisoners.,   The suffering of the captured soldiers, their homesickness, the loneliness, and the deprivations have been recorded in letters sent by Bryant T. Moore to his wife, Frances, now in possession of Mrs. Mabel Gilmore, of Fayette Street, maternal grand-daughter.,   During an epidemic of measles, Moore wrote from a Richmond hospital for the first time. It had been over two months since his capture. The letter, dated December 20, 1863, reads as follows:,   <blockquote><i> \"My dear wife and little babes,,   I have been in the hospital ever since the third of this month.,   I have had the measles and took cold on them and they went very bad with me though I have got so I can set up most of that time but I am suffering with rheumatism in my hips and back.,   I have suffered greatly with them since I left home. I also took the mumps the 15th day of October last and I had a very hard time with them.,   There is 18 of our boys in the hospital at this time. These are the names, L.F. Corbitt, W. Rakes, William Cunningham, Henry Lanham, J. Fairbarn, E.S. Waulrus, W.G. Townsend, A. Young, Asa Young, J. Brake, S. Smallridge and Harvey Long.,   They all have the measles.</i> (Editor's Note: All these would die in prison except Brake).,   James M. Clarkson has the fever. He too would die.),   <i>William Fleming, Granville Armstrong, Josiah B. Bennett, W. W. Cunningham, these four have the smallpox and they are in the smallpox hospital. I have not heard from them since they went there.</i> (These would die also.) James S. Wilson is dead. He died about two weeks ago. He had the measles. The rest of our company was well when I herd from. I and William Baker and Lewis F. Corbett are all getting along very well. Baker and Corbitt would die.) <i>Corbitt had a very easy time with the measles. Send his family word about him. I think we will be able to return to the Castle in five or six days. James Clarkson is on the mend.,   Tell Mary Ann that Franklin is well an has been well ever since he left.</i> (According to Mrs. Mollie Pritt, of 41 Randolph Street, who grew up as a child and neighbor to Mrs. Clarkson, this refers to Franklin Carson and his wife, Mary Ann Bartlett Clarkson. He died in a southern prison leaving his widow and two children, a son, Porter, and a daughter, Ollie, both of whom never married. Why Franklin's name is not listed with the deceased is unknown.) <i>Joseph Gawthrop has been well ever since he left. Joseph Gawthrop is wardmaster in the hospital where we are. Tell his wife he is well�\"</blockquote></i> ,   Bryant Moore was later taken to a hospital in Baltimore, Md., the Jarvis Hospital, maintained by the United Sates Sanitary Commission. He wrote his wife, Frances, on April 28, 1864 that four of the company had come on the boat with him, B. Geyer, Isaac Carter, and Jesse B. Nixon. At the same time he wrote that James Clarkson was dead. (I can find no record of Bezabel Geyer, but Carter was paroled and Jesse B. Nixon, although paroled, died in Baltimore in 1864 before he could reach home).,   In one of Frances' letters to Byrant, in the Gilmore collection, is one of April 29, 1864 in which she writes <i>\"Forget me not, Forget me never, Til younder sun, Is set forever.\"</i>,   On May 19, 1864, Bryant wrote:,   <blockquote><i> \"Dear wife,,   I take my pen in hand this morning all tho not able to write you a few lines to let you know how I am. Well, Francis, I am no better I will have to tell you the truth. My health is worst today than it ever was. I do not think that I will get able to come home by myself therefore I want you and Father to come after me. If a man's wife comes she can get him a furlough when no body else could and if you and Pa wants to get me home you must come as soon as you get this letter.,   I very weak and still getting weaker. I have no appetite to eat anything. I think that if I get home I will mend in time.,   It will cost you all rite smart but I would like to get home and see my dear little babes and brother and sister and mother and father before I bid adieu to this world.,   You must dress the best you can. I want Pa to wear my black cloth pants and my fine coat. I still have the direahea very bad and I want him to come with you to help me and I think I will get home if Pa is not able to come get some other man to come with you but I can't get a furlough unless you come. You both fix up the best you can. You may have to stay here two or three days before we can get off. I must close as I am to weak to write any more. Bring what mony you can. Goodby for this time�\"</i></blockquote> ,   Moore was given a parole and carried home. on a bed by train to Clarksburg: From there it took two days by road wagon to reach his home at Holly Grove, where he lied to the age of 74. His wife died at the age of 34, less than 10 years after his parole.,   Recorded are the names of the known members of the Upshur Militia and their fate for those descendants who may not until now realize the role their ancestors played in the Civil War.,   Paroled were Capt. Daniel Gould, David Fairbarn or Fairburn, Loyal U. McAvoy, conscripted and deserted, James F. Friel, Martin Rice, Bryant T. Moore, Isaac Carter, Jesse B. Nixon (who died before reaching home) and George W. Sharps. Perry Talbott was released from Castle Thunder Prison in Richmond, March, 1864.,   Escaping were Thomas Gawthrop, James M. Bennett, from Richmond, and Stalnaker Marteney from Salisbury, N.C., on November 1, 186. Men of whom I could find no record in either the Cutright k f History or Pioneer Reports, but who were listed as members of the Upshur Militia were James W. Winkle, John T. Starcher, Taylor Hyre, Elmer or Elmore Hyre (brothers, Elmer is the father of Lycurgus Hyre), Henry J. Hefner or Heavner, Bezabel Geyer or Bezlee Guyer, Taylor Brown, Joseph Crawford and Hiram Beam. J. Brake is referred to in Moore's letter.,   According to Miss Virginia Bly Hoover, French Creek historian, Joseph Crawford, grandfather of Mrs. Hugh Hyre and Freeman Hoover, both of French Creek, was captured with the militia, sent to Salisbury, N.C., and paroled. He was married Henry J. Hefner, Miss Hoover's grandfather, who was a resident of Slab Camp, was also captured and sent to Belle Island, where he was either paroled or exchanged.,   Listed in 1860 Census Report are: James W.

Both were sons of Elias and Nancy Brady Simons, whose home was situated on the divide between Stone Coal and Slab Camp. At the time of their capture at Centerville, Jacob was 23 years old and Closson, 21. They died of starvation and maltreatment, but the rest of the Simons family, three boys and four girls lived to be more than fourscore years.,   Descendants of Jacob and Closson great-nephews, Goff Ervin and Basin Ervin, both of French Creek, and the Rev. Elbert Crites, of Clarksburg; great nieces, Mrs. Lena Rollyson, of French Creek, and Mrs. Orpha Casto, of Adrian.,   The first contingent of Union prisoners to arrive at Andersonville came from Belle Island, Va., on February 15, 1864. From that time until April, 1865, nearly 50,000 men of the forces of the Federal Government were to be confined behind the stout pine walls of the prison stockade.,   The largest number of prisoners incarcerated at any one time was over 33,000 men. More than 900 prisoners died every month during the 13 months' existence of the prison. The greatest death toll on any one day occurred on August 23, 1864, when 97 prisoners died."},{"id":179086,"title":"Developing the Coal Field","pos":[37.32499,-81.31333],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=179086","desc":"Developing the Coal Field. . Stretching across western Mercer County through McDowell and southern Wyoming counties is the Pocahontas coalfield, one of the most productive, coal-bearing areas in the world. In this area, 6 seams of high-quality coal can be found close to the surface. The coal itself is semi-bituminous with a high carbon content that burns well and produces little smoke and ash. This quality encouraged its promoters to label it �smokeless.� It is the coal that fueled the industrialization of the nation. ,  Although it was one of the last of the Appalachian coalfields to be developed, early explorers and settlers in the 18th century observed outcrops of coal. These discoveries were noted as early as 1787 in Thomas Jefferson�s Notes on the State of Virginia. In the 1830s, Virginia�s first geologic survey explored this region and noted the outcrops of coal. The lack of transportation combined with the rugged terrain made development difficult. The area, then known as the Flat Top Mountains, was settled by a few hardy Scots-Irish pioneers who were content to live in relative isolation. ,  Major Jed Hotchkiss, renowned map-maker for General Thomas �Stonewall� Jackson during the Civil War, hoped that Virginia iron and limestone could be combined with West Virginia coal to launch a steel industry in Virginia. In 1873, he sent an engineer, Capt. Isaiah Welch, to survey the coal potential. Aided by locals, such as Jordon Nelson, the success Welch reported created great interest among capitalists in Philadelphia. Nelson, himself a blacksmith living near Pocahontas, Virginia, had discovered a coal seam at the time of the Civil War. He dug coal for his own use and operated the first retail coal business in the area, often packing � bushel sacks of coal on horseback to deliver to customers. Locally known as the �Nelson� seam, it was 13 feet thick and of superior quality. Later, it was renamed the Pocahontas #3 seam. ,  At Hotchkiss� urging, a group of investors formed a railroad company which would, in 1881, become the Norfolk and Western Railway and provide a link between the coalfields and the east coast. Prior to 1903, under West Virginia law, it was illegal for railroad companies to own large tracts of land. To get around this restriction, the railroad investors formed the Southwest Virginia Development Company to purchase about 200,000 acres of land in the Flat Top area. The company would become the Flat Top Land Association and represented a combination of railroad and land holding interests that gave it great power in directing and profiting from the development of this coalfield. ,  As the nation became more industrialized, surveyors, engineers, speculators and would-be capitalists gravitated to this forgotten frontier in search of coal. Developing a coalfield required precise geological knowledge as well as an infrastructure of labor, housing and transportation. In a region that was underpopulated, it required coal operators to build towns to secure the required labor near the mining operations. The development of the coalfield reshaped the geography of the region."},{"id":179095,"title":"Owen (Mac) McCafferty","pos":[39.47027,-80.13133],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=179095","desc":"Owen (Mac) McCafferty. . <center>Military Service  World War II and Korea  Died March 24, 1994.

The development of the southern West Virginia coalfields Was dependent upon transportation, specifically the railroad. In 1881, Thomas Graham and a group of investors from Philadelphia purchased the unsuccessful Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad, which operated between Norfolk and Bristol, Virginia. Through the support of the banking house of F. W. Clark and Company, it was reorganized as the Norfolk and Western Railway, with F. J. Kimball its director and later president. With the purchase of large tracts of coal-rich land by the Flat Top Land Association, a sister company also organized by Graham and Clark, all that was needed tor the large-scale development of the coal was the expansion of the railroad into the area. ,  F. W. Kimball led the push of the N&W into the region. The railroad reached Pocahontas, Virginia in 1882 and shipped the first car of coal from the Pocahontas mine in March of 1883. The N&W continued building westward to Higginbotham Summit, which later became the town of Bluefield. Here, the company constructed a terminal, division office, repair shops, a roundhouse and other facilities. The N&W built extensions into the coalfield and eventually extended itself westward to Ironton, Ohio, where it connected with other carriers to access mid-western markets. ,  The railroad exercised considerable control in the coalfields through the lease of land, owned by the Flat Top Land Association, to coal operators and by the distribution of coal cars. Ultimately, it was the N&W that played the defining role in the development of the Pocahontas coalfield in southern West Virginia. ,  <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  <b>Frederick James Kimball</b> (1844-1903), a native of Philadelphia Pennsylvania, was a civil engineer by training. At the age of 18, Kimball went to work for the Pennsylvania Railroad. He spent two years in England learning about their rail system. After his return, he worked at a variety of jobs, became involved in the construction of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, and eventually became a partner in the Philadelphia banking firm of E. W. Clark and Company. In 1881, Kimball became the President of the Norfolk and Western Railway. His knowledge of the geology of the Flat Top Mountain, led him to build a branch line along Mill Creek, thereby opening the Pocahontas coalfield and extending the N&W lines into the area. During his tenure as President, the N&W expanded west to Columbus, Ohio, and into North Carolina. The N&W also acquired the largest landowner in the coalfield, the Flat Top Coal Land Association, renaming it the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Corporation (later known as the Pocahontas Land Corporation). He was a major contributor to the development of the Pocahontas field and in extending the routes, and shaping the future of the railway. The town of Kimball is, named for him. ,  <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  Bramwell was fortunate to have excellent rail service. At one point, there were as many as 16 daily train stops. It was not a coal town, rather Bramwell was a service center and residential community to many of the coal operators. This spared the town having any of the trappings of the mining towns, such as coke ovens."},{"id":179100,"title":"The Workers","pos":[37.32497,-81.31334],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=179100","desc":"The Workers. National Coal Heritage Trail.  ,  Bramwell was not just the home to the owners and operators of the mines. The productive Pocahontas coalfield needed labor. Native Appalachians, immigrants of southern and eastern Europe and African-Americans from the agricultural south filled the need, coming into the coalfields with little or no industrial experience.,   Mines were situated close enough to Bramwell to allow workers to live there, walking or taking the train to work. The 1900 census shows the 35 African-Americans coal and coke workers and 28 white coal and coke workers were living within the corporate limits of the town, which at that time had a population of 824.,   Miners also lived within the communities of Coopers, Simmons, and Freeman. These coal towns, all established by 1890, developed along with Bramwell. Collectively, some estimates show the greater Bramwell area having a population of 4000 at the beginning of the 20th century.,   Early in the development of these communities, both workers and mine operators lived in the same neighborhoods. These smaller self-sufficient communities had their own churches, schools, stores, and post offices. Simmons and Coopers were complete with railroad stations. As mines became more established and revenues increased, the owners and operators relocated to Bramwell or Bluefield.,   <i>[Sidebar:]</i> ,  <small> The development of the coalfield attracted a diverse workforce to Bramwell, including African-Americans, Italians, English, Hungarians, Irish, Welch, Dutch, German, Lithuanian, Russian, and Scott, as well as locals. Even John Cooper, one of the early coal barons, was a native of England. The 1900 census counted 824 citizens within the city limits, of whom 221 were black with 31 listed as coal miners, 4 coke workers, and other occupations covering a range from lawyer to domestic help.,   <b>Immigrant Entrepeneur,</b> John Cooper (1842�1898). ,  Born in the mining and industrial district of South Staffordshire, England, he started working in coal mines at the age of 6 as a trapper boy ,  opening and closing ventilation doors in a mine. A self-educated man, Cooper came to America in 1862 and worked in the anthracite mining area of Pennsylvania.,   In 1873, he moved to Fayette County, WV and began an unsuccessful mining venture at Hawks Nest, in the newly opened New River coalfield. In 1884, he founded the Mill Creek Coal Coke Company with partner Joseph Beury. Cooper founded a community that bore his name (Coopers ,  just south of Bramwell) where he made his home in order to be-near his mining operations.,   Cooper also entered into business with Jenkin Jones (a founder of Caswell Creek Coal and Coke), became President of the .Bank of Bramwell, and organized the Republican Party in Fayette and Mercer counties.,   Modern Bramwell is actually a composite community. The core town of Bramwell was incorporated in 1888. Its neighbors were the towns of Freeman (Simmons) and Coopers, each with its own train station and post office. Bramwell eventually absorbed both communities, but each still maintained their own post office. In 1993, the post office at Coopers closed followed by Freeman in 1997. </small>"},{"id":179162,"title":"Evolution of a Town","pos":[37.32497,-81.31344],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=179162","desc":"Evolution of a Town. .  , Bramwell is situated on a horseshoe bend of the Bluestone River at the eastern edge of the Pocahontas coalfield. This was an ideal location for a town. It was close to the coalfield operations yet removed from the dirt and noise of the industry. ,  In 1883, Bramwell was established by the Flat Top Land Company. This powerful company owned most of the coal lands in the area and planned to lease them to coal companies for a substantial profit. The company reserved the flattest land along the Bluestone for its office at Bramwell. Coal operators flocked to the town to make deals, set up offices, and build residences. Mines were opened nearby, close enough to allow workers to live in the town and either walk or take the train to work. ,  By 1885, the town was formally laid out in lots for homes, offices, and businesses. The town was incorporated in 1888 and named by J.H. Bramwell, an engineer from New York who served as the town�s postmaster. According to local history, Bramwell stated in poetic form. <blockquote>Every little baby has a name, ,  This little town should have the same, ,  So now, if you will agree, ,  I choose to name it after me.</blockquote> Bramwell grew rapidly during the 1890s. It boasted four churches, eight retail stores, a school, town building, fraternal halls, numerous coal company offices and the water, sewage and electric utilities to support them. As many as fourteen passenger trains made daily stops at the depot. By the turn of the century, the town had acquired the reputation as the business and residential center for the wealthiest coal barons in the region. ,  In 1910, Bramwell lost its position as the leading business center in the Pocahontas coalfield. Two events played a critical factor. First, the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company, successor to the Flat Top Land Association, decided to move its office from Bramwell to nearby Bluefield. The second, less than a week after this announcement, a disastrous fire broke out in a local pool room and bowling alley, destroying the business district. Even though the town was rebuilt, Bramwell gradually became more of a residential community than a center of business. ,  Bramwell underwent a period of decline in the 1920s as more and more of the business and social life gravitated to Bluefield. Many of the original coal barons passed from the scene, leaving a void of leadership. The coal industry also fell upon hard times. Over-expansion, declining coal prices, and a surplus of coal brought the Great Depression to the coalfields early. Perhaps the worst blow was the downfall of the Bank of Bramwell. Once a powerful financial institution, the decline in the coal industry drained its reserves and led to its closure in 1933. ,  Bramwell has survived. Today, it is a remarkable residential community preserving a glimpse into the Gilded Age of America when bold men known as Coal Barons, crafted empires built upon coal."},{"id":179168,"title":"The Coal Barons","pos":[37.32498,-81.31347],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=179168","desc":"The Coal Barons. . While the description of Bramwell as a town of millionaires can be viewed as an exaggeration, it did have a significant number of wealthy families. Their wealth was built largely upon the rapid growth of the Pocahontas coalfield and Bramwell�s strategic location. It was home to the Bank of Bramwell and the powerful Flat Top Land Association. Individuals connected to either of these businesses and many of the pioneering coal operations acquired great financial success. Many of the pioneer operators brought with them considerable mining experience, most of it acquired in the anthracite coalfields of Pennsylvania. ,  The prominent coal operators of the Pocahontas Coalfield are shown in the photo to the left. Missing from the picture are John Freeman and William H. Thomas. ,  <b>John Freeman (1822 1892).</b> Born in England, he came to the U.S. about 1850 and settled in Treverton, Pennsylvania, where he worked in the anthracite coal mines. At the end of the Civil War, he came to Clifton Forge, Virginia to engage in iron making. During the 1870s he moved to the New River field and worked at the Fire Creek Mine of Joseph Beury, where he met Jenkin Jones. He partnered with Jones to start the Caswell Creek Coal and Coke Company. In his 60s at the time of this venture, he continued his association with Jones for the remainder of his life. The town of Freeman, northeast of Bramwell, bears his name. ,  <b>William Harris Thomas (1862-1918).</b> A native of South Wales, he came with his parents to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania at age 6. In 1885, he came to the Pocahontas field and accepted a position in the store of the Southern Virginia Improvement Company at Pocahontas, Virginia. His first mining experience was with the Algoma mine in McDowell County. Later, he started the Thomas Coal and Coke Company and built an impressive residence in Bramwell. At the time of his death, he was president of the Thomas Coal and Coke Company, Crystal Coal and Coke Company, Flat Top Mining Company, McDowell Coal and Coke Company, Eclipse Milling Company, chairman of the board of the Flat Top Fuel Company, and a director of the Bank of Bramwell. ,  <b>Jonathan P. Bowen (1830-1902).</b> Like many of the early operators, Bowen was born in Wales and brought up in the Pennsylvania coalfields (Schuylkill County). He was both able and ambitious and became superintendent of mines in Pennsylvania and southwestern Virginia. In 1884. Bowen and William Booth opened one of the early mines ,  generally regarded as the fourth ,  in the Flat Top field. Located at Freeman in Mercer County, the organization was first called William Booth and Company. However, in 1889 the name was changed to the Booth-Bowen Coal and Coke Company. In 1892, Bowen succeeded Booth as President and continued in that position until his death. The office was the filled by his son, William Henry Bowen, generally known as Harry. ,  <b>Isaac Thomas Mann (1863-1932).</b> Much of the image of Bramwell evolved with the career of I.T. Mann. He was one of the very few of Bramwell�s coal barons born in West Virginia (Fort Spring, Greenbrier County). His career began in 1885 in a bank in Alderson belonging to his uncle, Jame E. Mann. In 1889, as the major stockholder in the Bank of Bramwell, J.E. Mann installed his nephew as cashier of the Bank of Bramwell. From this position. he built the bank into a powerful financial institution and invested in local mines. He eventually created the Pocahontas Consolidated Coal Company, later known as the Pocahontas Fuel Company and the largest locally owned coal producer. In 1901, he closed a land deal with Norfolk and Western that resulted in a profit of $10 million and brought the interests of U.S. Steel into the region. In 1901 the Bank was worth over $1 million and ranked third of the 115 state banks. By 1923 its holdings had increased to $13 million. The decline in coal prices and the Great Depression resulted in the closing of the bank in 1933, a year after Mann�s death. According to a relative he was �worth 578 million one day and owed $81 million the next.� I.T. Mann was one of the great and finally tragic success stories of the coalfields. Bramwell benefited from his presence, financially and in other ways. In 1904. he gave the town�s Presbyterian congregation a new church building. The town of Itmann, in Wyoming County, is named in his honor by the directors of the Pocahontas Fuel Company. ,  <b>John Cooper (1842-1898).</b> Born in the mining and industrial district of South Staffordshire. England, he started working in coal mines at the age of 6. Self-educated. Cooper came to America in 1862 and worked in the anthracite mining area of Pennsylvania until 1873. He moved to Fayette County. West Virginia and began an unsuccessful mining venture at Hawks Nest, in the newly opened New River coalfield. In 1884, he joined with Joseph Beury to form the Mill Creek Coal and Coke Company, which shipped the first railroad car of coal from the West Virginia section of the Pocahontas field. Cooper made his home in the community of Coopers, just south of Bramwell, to be near his mining operations. He became involved in business with Jenkin Jones and was, at one time, President of the Bank of Bramwell. ,  <b>Jenkin Jones (1841-1916).</b> Jones was born in Wales of a coal mining family. In 1863, he came to Pennsylvania and worked in the anthracite mines. By 1872 he had migrated to Clifton Forge, Virginia where he operated a small iron ore mine. Following the path of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in opening up the New River coalfield, he worked the Fire Creek mine owned by Joseph Beury. In 1884, with John Freeman. he leased 1400 acres from the Flat Top Land Association and started the Caswell Creek Coal and Coke Company, the third operation to open in the Pocahontas field. In 1907, he merged his operations with I. T. Mann�s Pocahontas Consolidated Coal Company. Jones was one of the coal barons who started their operations with little capital, sometimes described as, with �one mule, one mine car. and a few picks and shovels.� The town of Jenkinjones was named in his honor by his son, James Elwood Jones."},{"id":179170,"title":"Feeding the Confederacy","pos":[37.40514,-81.14348],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=179170","desc":"Feeding the Confederacy. .

Before the coming of the railroad and the whitewater rafting industry, commerce along the New River was carried by long, flat-bottomed boats called batteaux. The New River has always been an important travel corridor through the rugged Appalachian Mountains. The New River watershed helped bridge the Eastern Continental Divide and the Mississippi River, joining the James River�s Atlantic watershed with the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers. From the earliest days of our nation, George Washington had envisioned a cross-country canal route along this pathway. ,  Beginning in the mid-1800s, the Army Corps of Engineers blasted sluice channels through the ledges and rapids of the New and Greenbrier Rivers for the use of commercial batteau traffic. The batteaux were propelled along the shallow river by crews pushing long poles along the side of the boats, and steering with long sweeping rudders at each end. The boats carried lumber, agricultural produce, and mercantile products. ,  Washington�s dream of the southern Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was dashed by the Lower New River Gorge�s whitewater rapids, which were too wild for batteau navigation. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, built with the help of supplies carried by batteaux, finally connected the watersheds in 1872. ,  <i>(sidebar)</i> ,  The name batteau derives from the French word bateau, meaning boat. The plural form is Batteaux. ,  Many of the captains and crews of the New River batteaux were African Americans. ,  Thirty feet long and constructed of white oak, the �Minner� is a historic reproduction built in 2005.

Vital Crossing. During the war, Union and Confederate forces crossed the Greenbrier River covered bridge many times to attack and counterattack through Pocahontas County. This area was then called Marlin's Bottom, on or near three turnpikes. Across the river, the Huttonsville, Marlin's Bottom, and Lewisburg Turnpike (now U.S. Route 219) linked the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike (U.S Route 250) on the north with Lewisburg on the south. The Marlin's Bottom and Huntersville Turnpike to Huntersville, six miles behind you, and the Huntersville and Warm Springs Turnpike that continued east to Warm Springs in Virginia now comprise State Route 39. These hard surfaced turnpikes were strategically important for the armies moving through the rugged terrain, especially during brutal winters.,   Confederate Gen, Robert E.

Kanawha Boulevard.  ,  Kanawha Boulevard has gone by various names throughout history. The Boulevard was known as Front Street when \"Charles Town\" was chartered in 1794. Through the years, it has been called First Street, Water Street and Kanawha Street prior to being renamed Kanawha Boulevard in the late 1920s.,   The Boulevard served as part of the James River and Kanawha Turnpike and is currently part of the Midland Trail National Scenic Byway. In the late 1930s, the Boulevard was modified into a four-lane highway by the Public Works Administration (PWA).,   The PWA was formed by the National Industrial Recovery Act on June 16, 1933 as a New Deal program to help the country climb out of the Great Depression. The PWA was signed into legislation during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first 100 days in office to fund large-scale construction projects to provide employment, stabilize purchasing power, improve public welfare, and revive American industry.,   The short lived PWA (1933-1941) is often confused with the better known Works Progress Administration (WPA which was created two years after the PWA to fund smaller construction projects throughout the country.,   Kanawha Boulevard and its contributing elements are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places due to their association with the PWA. The contributing elements include the original stone slope treatment, drainage outlets, recreational pathways and steps. In 2014, the original stone slope treatment was enscapsulated and the lower sets of steps and drainage outlets were removed as part of a Section 14 project authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1946.

Stores, restaurants, hotels, movie theatres, and banks opened along its length, with many of the buildings rebuilt in masonry after the 1910 fire that erased the first generation of Main Street buildings.  ,  Complementing the commerce found along Main Street, Mill and Center Streets served as secondary arteries running southeast to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and the bank of Dunloup Creek.

Imagine shoveling coal all day while balanced on your knees! In the coal mines of the gorge, the height of the mines corresponded to the height of the coal seam, in some cases just three feet tall. To loosen the coal, explosives were set of at the face of the seam. A miner would then load the dislodged coal into an empty car. Wages in the 1920s ranged from 48 to 70 cents per ton, and an average miner could load eight or nine tons a day.  ,  On payday, many expenses such as rent, electricity, tools, and company store advances were deducted before a miner received his pay.

Prior to the days of refrigeration springhouses served a dual purpose. They were a source of fresh cool water as well as a place to keep food cool.

The cool water kept the interior of the springhouse cool. ,  Crocks, jars and other types of containers were used to store milk, butter, eggs, and occasionally tea and lemonade in the springhouse. Sometimes the container was partially submerged in the water to take advantage of the cool temperature.

As part of that 2016 celebration, the planting of three sycamores symbolizing the third century of our community was commissioned by our city. A second sycamore was planted in Jawbone Park. The third bicentennial sycamore was planted along the bank of the Buckhannon River beside the boat ramp on West Virginia Wesleyan College�s campus.  ,  The original �Pringle Tree� was again celebrated on December 2, 2016 before another substantial gathering of our residents as part of the City Seal mural rededication ceremony conducted downtown at the corner of West Main and North Locust Streets.

The attack failed as a detachment of the 11th West Virginia Infantry (US) arrived to reinforce the Federals. The garrison lost only eight men, and the Confederates fled to Moorefield.,   On November 28, 1864, Confederate Gen. Thomas L. Rosser's cavalrymen captured the Federal camp and New Creek Station on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad along the river in front of you. On November 26, Union Gen. Benjamin F. Kelley had ordered Col. George R. Latham, commanding here, to send a detachment out on patrol. When Rosser's men, disguised in Union uniforms, rode into New Creek from behind you two days later, the Federals thought it was their detachment returning. Rosser's troopers destroyed buildings and supplies, captured the fort, and then fled.,    For most of the war, Federal regiments camped near the railroad to protect it. In August 1862, the 23rd Illinois Infantry began building Fort Fuller, named for Illinois Adjutant General Allen C. Fuller, here atop the ridge. It was later called Fort Kelley, for Gen. Kelley, who led the defense of the railroad in Maryland and West Virginia. Batteries on Queens Point and New Creek Mountain supported the fort, which had earthen walls, ditches, and five cannons.,   <i>[Sidebar:]</i> , <small> Walter Lowry, born in Ohio on Oct. 15, 1845, enlisted in the 32nd Ohio Infantry on Aug. 1, 1861, and fought in most of the major campaigns including Vicksburg and Atlanta.

Johnston had directed Jackson to determine whether the Federals were in force and to retire if they were. Outnumbered, Jackson fought a brief delaying action and then fell back toward Martinsburg. Patterson eventually occupied the city but was discharged at the end of the month for his slowness., This first Civil War engagement in the Shenandoah Valley was fought here on the farm of William Rush Porterfield. Porterfield�s wife and their four children fled to the house of a nearby relative. The Fifth Virginia Infantry occupied the house and farm buildings just as the Union troops came into view; Confederate sharpshooters opened fire from the house and barn. Colonel Kenton Harper, Fifth Virginia Infantry, reported that the house and farm buildings were �key to my position.� The Federal artillery quickly replied, damaging the house and setting fire to the barn, which burned to the ground., After Jackson�s men withdrew, Union troops immediately established a makeshift hospital in the house to care for the wounded of both sides.

The tree's native range extended from Georgia all the way to Maine and west to the Ohio River Valley. In the Appalachian Mountains, roughly one tree in four was an American chestnut. The American chestnut could grow very large and fast, allowing it to become the dominant tree in many areas. In mature stands, the tree could grow for 300 years or more, reach over 100 feet in height and more than 6 feet in diameter. These traits inspired the nickname \"The Mighty Giant.\",   American chestnut trees bloom in the early summer. Where the trees once grew thickly on Appalachian ridges, their creamy white flowers made the mountainsides appear snow covered. The native wildlife depended extensively on the nutritious nuts, especially deer, turkeys, squirrels and bears.,   <b>The \"Cradle to Grave� Tree</b>,   Chestnutting (gathering chestnuts) was both a social activity and provided income, particularly in rural communities. Railroad cars were loaded with nuts for shipment to the larger cities, where vendors could sell them freshly roasted. Farmers fattened their livestock on the nuts and used the nuts in traditional recipes, and even ground the nutmeat into flour.,   The tree was also an excellent source of lumber. It grew straight, often branch-free for the first 50 feet or more. It was straight-grained, easily split, rot resistant and lighter than oak. Chestnut was known as the \"cradle to grave tree,� as it was used for both cradles and caskets, as well as many other everyday items. The lumber was also used for split-rail fences, post-and-beam construction, railroad ties, shingles, panels, and telephone poles; some of which are still in use today.,   (Photo Captions):,   Original range of the American chestnut ,  Gathering chestnuts 1878 ,  American chestnuts, Smoky Mountains, circa 1910"},{"id":180860,"title":"Jackson's Prayer Service","pos":[38.6178,-79.346],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=180860","desc":"Jackson's Prayer Service.

In the 1910s, the East Gulf Coal Company opened what came to be known as the Helen Mine and Coal Camp. Realizing their need to attract a more reliable and family-oriented workforce, the coal operators began constructing \"model towns.� Here in the model town of Helen there was a boarding house, company store, clubhouse, movie theater, and even a telephone exchange. Residential areas and businesses were all segregated. Although they lived in separate neighborhoods, African Americans could vote, hold public office, and send their children to school. ,  While black miners were segregated in the community, some equality did exist underground in the coal mines of southern West Virginia. In the mines, black workers were provided equal wages for equal work. About 75 percent of black workers became coal loaders. Others were daymen and coke workers. Picking and loading coal was hard, dangerous, back-breaking work, but provided the most opportunity for earning money. ,  Helen's population began to decline, especially for African Americans, in the 1950s with the advent of new machinery. After 1953, the services of hand loaders or unskilled laborers were no longer needed. The town, like so many, began its long decline in population and vitality.

That was the case with Helen. Helen was established around 1919, and named after the daughter of G.W. Stevens, who was the president of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad.</b> The East Gulf Coal Company was the first to open a mine in the area. In the last six months of 1919, the East Gulf numbers 1, 3, and 4 mines produced a total of 62,837 tons of coal, increasing to 84,543 tons in the first six months of 1920. Later the Koppers Coal Company began mining the rich deposits of coal. Through the years Koppers Coal would later operate as the Eastern Gas and Fuel Company, and finally as the Eastern Associated Coal Corporation. ,  Helen was typical of coal towns found throughout the area. There was a company store, restaurant, movie theater, school, church, and even a boarding house for single miners. Helen was also a place with a very diverse population as black and white, Italian, Polish, and other immigrants worked side by side in the mines. Just east of this location was a baseball field where spirited games were played each week against teams from other mining towns across the region. At the height of the coal boom, thousands of miners worked in the coal mines in and around Helen.

Eventually, it became so popular that leagues were formed across the area, each with a regular season schedule, playoffs, and a championship game. Many of the teams were sponsored by coal companies. ,  Almost every mining town in the region had its own baseball team, including Helen which was a member of the Raleigh County League. Other leagues which sprang up around the area include the Black Diamond League, the United Mine Workers League, and the Tri-County League. ,  Everyone in town found themselves involved in these spirited games in one way or another, whether it be on the field playing or cheering from the stands. These games meant a lot not only to the players, but to the residents of each town as well, who took much pride in their teams. That pride was shown in full force as teams such as the Cincinnati Reds and Baltimore Orioles often toured the coalfields and took on the local teams, with the locals coming out with a victory many times."},{"id":186958,"title":"Camp Lightfoot","pos":[37.6363,-81.31453],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=186958","desc":"Camp Lightfoot. . <b>Children in coal towns like Helen were sure to find many activities that kept them entertained throughout the year.

Caldwell, whose family owned and occupied the stately brick house, \"Elmhurst,\" on the bank of the Greenbrier River. Prior to its construction in 1824,a wooden covered toll bridge was built across the river and the house was used as a stagecoach stop for many years. The bridge was burned in 1862 following the Battle of Lewisburg. At the turn of the century, Caldwell was selected by th� West Virginia Pulp and Paper Co. as thesite for a new paper mill. After much objection from the local people concerned with polluting runoff into the river, the decision was made to build the mill in Covington, Virginia. Caldwell became a major stop on the Greenbrier line of the C&O Railway as trains began to move lumber, goods and passengers up and down the Greenbrier Valley.,   <b>Arks on The Greenbrier</b> ,  Farm families eagerly waited for the spring thaw when the ice would break and go down the river. In the years before 1908 that meant a log drive on the Greenbrier. It was an exciting event for people in the river communities. \"Arks,\" or house rafts, were built of spruce and were seventy to one hundred feet long. A low log house was erected on each raft. The bunkhouse ark contained double-decked bunks and a large wood stove. A secbnd ark carried the cook shack and dining room, and sometimes there was a third ark to carry teams of horses and equipment. One notable log drive to Ronceverte in 1899 consisted of six arks that carried twenty horses and living quarters for 107 men.,   <b>Kate's Mountain</b> ,  Located a short distance to the east of the river is Kate's Mountain, pictured here in \"Scribner's Magazine.\" The legend of how it got its name is as beautiful as the mountain itself. The first settler to claim land on the Greenbrier tributary of Howard's Creek was Nicholas Carpenter in about 1750. He was later killed by Indians at a fort on the Jackson River. His wife Kate and their infant daughter had stayed behind at the Howard's Creek home site and they too were attacked. Kate escaped with the baby in her arms to the top of a mountain overlooking the creek. Legend has it that mother and child escaped harm by hiding in a hollowed-out log and that to commemorate her courage, the mountain standing across from The Greenbrier Resort's main entrance still bears her name.,   <b>Log Drive on The Greenbrier</b> ,  The timber boom in the mountains of West Virginia lasted well into the 1920's. The rapid removal of timber from the vast virgin forests was hastened by the arrival of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1900. But, long before that, there were sawmills scattered throughout the mountains on either side of the Greenbrier River. As the lumber industry began to grow, the need arose for a way to get the logs to the often-distant mills. Thus, the practice of using rafts to carry the logs downstream was employed and log drives commenced on the river to supply the hungry teeth of the big mill owned by the St. Lawrence Boom and Manufacturing Company south of Caldwell, in Ronceverte.,   <b>\"River Hogs\"</b> ,  The men driving logs were known as \"river hogs\" and their job was both demanding and dangerous. After the logs were rolled into the swollen stream, the men and horse teams followed on the shore to refloat logs that became stranded on the banks. Much of the work was performed in icy water. Log jams occurred frequently as the swift current would pile the logs into tangled stacks. Only the most skilled drivers could walk the face of the jam to break loose the key logs. This would cause the jam to break suddenly sending the men jumping and scrambling for safety on the churning mass of logs. Accounts vary on the date of the last log drive on the Greenbrier. The Editor of The Pocahontas Times, Calvin W. Price, claimed to have seen the last drive on St. Patrick's Day ,  March 17, 1907.,   <b>Camp Shaw-Mi-Del-Eca\"</b> ,  They came to hike and camp, to play tennis and go horseback riding, They learned the ways and legends of local tribes - the Shawnee, the Mingo, the Delaware and the Seneca. And they looked forward to the canoe trips on the Greenbrier River. They were the boys of Shaw-Mi-Del-Eca. Greenbrier Military School's Camp for Boys was located along the river in Caldwell and operated for 8 weeks every summer until the closing of the school in 1973. Water sports, such as surfboard riding and fishing, were enjoyed in a private, artificial lake formed by a concrete dam across a section of the river.,   <b>\"Riders of the Flood\"</b> ,  The St. Lawrence Boom and Manufacturihg Company was the first company to drive logs down the Greenbrier River, which was wide and free of obstacles making it ideally suited for a log drive. Trees were cut during the summer and fall then \"skidded\" to a slide by teamsters with horses. Once cold weather arrived the slide was watered down to produce a thick coat of ice so that the logs would easily slide down the mountain to the landing below. There they were stacked to await the runoff from spring rains that filled the \"splash\" dams with enough water for the logs to float. When the gates were opened the rushing water would carry the logs downstream.,   <b>C&O Depot at Whitcomb</b> ,  The Whitcomb train depot was located at milepost O at the junction of the Greenbrier Division with the C&O main line pictured here. The Greenbrier Line switched off to the left and the main tracks curved before crossing the Greenbrier River. The depot was the standard style with a switch tower built on its roof. The distance markings on mileposts along the route were measured from the junction at Whitcomb. From there to Winterburn, in northernmost Pocahontas County, the railroad followed the river to its head, so, of course, the line was ascending. The railroad curved as the river curved. It was anything but straight. 64% of the line was in curves.,   <b>Train Station at North Caldwell</b> ,  The C&O station at Caldwell was originally listed on the schedule as Little Sulphur. Once the depot building was completed in 1901 ihe name changed to Hunter, and finally in 1902 was listed as North Caldwell. The station had numerous facilities including a section foreman's house, bunkhouse, section tool house, and stock pens. The railroad also operated a farm and nursery here for a few years. The North Caldwell station was closed in 1967. On December 28, 1978, the last train made its run from Durbin heading for Hinton. The Greenbrier line of the Chesapeake and Ohio faded into history, passing through Ronceverte unnoticed."},{"id":187217,"title":"Murder of Ambrose Meadows","pos":[38.67195,-79.30257],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=187217","desc":"Murder of Ambrose Meadows.

Fort Boreman Historical Park. Fort Boreman was a military fortification constructed by the United States Army during the Civil War. The protection of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the two turnpikes, the Northwestern and the Staunton-Parkersburg, and river port facilities was essential to the Union war effort.,   Fort Boreman gave the sentinels atop the hill a grand view of river traffic, the railroads, and the turnpikes. Under the command of Col Daniel Frost, the soldiers of Company A of the Eleventh West Virginia Infantry began constructing the fort in June 1863. The fort itself was a triangular structure with a powder magazine. There were five gun stations on the northwest and northeast faces of the fort. The artillery pieces at the citadel included two 12-pound siege guns, one six-pound field gun, and two three-inch guns.,   The fortification consisted of trenches capable of holding 100 men. Fort Boreman never saw any hostile military action, and its guns were fired only on celebratory occasions. One soldier, Richard Miller, was killed on August 14, 1863, when during one such occasion, a gun misfired.,   Fort Boreman was occupied in the last year of the war by Batteries D, G, and H, First West Virginia Light Artillery, and finally by the Thirty-Second New York Independent Battery. Battery D, also known as the Wheeling Light Artillery, was under the command of Capt. John Carlin.,   In 1898 the Parkersburg Post of the Grand Army of the Republic, a Union veterans organization, erected a cannon and carriage atop the hill, which came to be affectionately known as \"Long Tom.� This vintage Civil War artillery piece was moved in 1921 to Parkersburg's City Park, where Wood Countians still honor the gun as a symbol of the region's rich historical heritage."},{"id":189775,"title":"Historic Parkersburg (West) Virginia","pos":[39.26212,-81.56857],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=189775","desc":"Historic Parkersburg (West) Virginia. Fort Boreman Historical Park. In 1773 Robert Thornton claimed 400 acres on the north bank of the Little Kanawha River where he built a cabin and cultivated land in the area that is now downtown Parkersburg. Thornton sold his claim to Capt. Alexander Parker for $50 in 1785. The area was permanently settled in 1785 by Capt. James Neal and others from Springhill Township, Fayette County, PA. First chartered by the Virginia Assembly in 1800 as Newport, the town was named Parkersburg in 1810 and was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly in 1820.,   In the years before the Civil War, Parkersburg became the terminus of two state roads, the Northwestern Turnpike, completed in 1838, and the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike, finished in 1847. In 1857, the Northwestern Virginia Railroad, the southern trunk of the B&O Railroad, was completed to Parkersburg. The absolute necessity of protecting the turnpikes and the railroad made Parkersburg one of the most strategic spots in the state during the Civil War.,   At the beginning of the Civil War, Parkersburg had a population of 2,500. The completion of the southern branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1857 increased the population of Parkersburg, then the largest Ohio River town between Wheeling and Cincinnati.,   Arthur I. Boreman of Parkersburg served as West Virginia's first governor from 1863 to 1869.

General History.  ,  Fort Boreman is the site of a Civil War fort, located on what had been called Mount Logan, overlooking the valley formed by the confluence of the Little Kanawha and Ohio Rivers at Parkersburg. Built by Union troops in 1863 to protect the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad terminal and the key commercial river facilities in the valley, Fort Boreman was named for West Virginia's first governor, Parkersburg citizen Arthur I. Boreman.,   In May 1861, Union troops began occupation of Parkersburg. Because of the controlling vantage point offered from Mount Logan, troops from the Eighteenth Ohio Infantry soon occupied the hilltop. In 1863, two forts were planned for the protection of the railroad facilities at Parkersburg: one atop Mount Logan and the other was to be situated on Prospect Hill, today's Quincy Hill. Though the Prospect Hill project was never completed, the fortification that would be known as Fort Boreman was commenced in the summer of 1863. Although Fort Boreman was never under eminent threat during the Civil War, one soldier was killed and another seriously injured during a ceremonial firing when a cannon exploded in August of 1863. While the early years of the hill's history are shrouded in mystery, it is known that it played a role in early Wood County as timber was cut from its slopes, floated across the Little Kanawha River and used to construct the county's first \"official\" courthouse.,   The Fort Boreman site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Work on Fort Boreman Park began in 1997 when the Wood County Historical and Preservation Society held a meeting to discuss its creation. The Society was awarded $2,000 by the Wood County Commission to begin cutting thick brush from the hill, which took two years. Fort Boreman Historical Park opened to the public in 2007 as a lasting memorial to the Wood County Bicentennial Celebration of 1999. Today, the park features a reconstructed Union Civil War fortification, trenches, interpretive signage, picnic shelters, nature trail and spectacular views of Parkersburg and the Ohio River."},{"id":189780,"title":"Fort Boreman","pos":[39.26229,-81.56924],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=189780","desc":"Fort Boreman. .

Blennerhassett is known for his Blennerhasset Burr participation in the mysterious Aaron Burr military enterprise of 1806-07; the island was the staging ground for boats, supplies, and volunteers who departed in December 1806 for the wilderness of the lower Mississippi River.

There was an inner and outer depot, a roadhouse, and repair shops that were vital to maintaining the railroad's rolling stock. The impressive system also included a telegraph office, two-story freight shed, a loading dock powered by two steam-operated elevators, a stockyard, and a wharf along the Little Kanawha River.,   Parkersburg in 1861 was mostly confined to the area that is now the downtown section. Several hotels such as the luxurious Swann House hosted travelers and military officers. The area near the Little Kanawha River was notoriously grimy and lawless, and was noted for its saloons, brothels, and seedy boarding houses.,   During the war there were at least five military hospitals as well as a supply depot and commissary in the city. Hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers passed through the city, staying temporarily while their trains were ferried across the Ohio River. The war brought great changes to Parkersburg, as it was transformed almost overnight from a sleepy courthouse town to a hub of industry and transportation.,   The Civil War unalterably shaped the character of the city. By 1870, the population had increased to over 5,500. The birth of the oil and gas industry soon transformed Parkersburg into an industrial center, where entrepreneurs fashioned a grand and glorious gaslit society.

Carpenter, a well-known ferry business owner in Pleasants County, West Virginia, was witnessing the increase of automobile ownership in the early 1900's, and through this phenomena, commerce was increasing as well. Being the visionary that he was, Hiram felt if a bridge were to be built in St. Marys it would allow for a greater increase in commerce in the region with virtually unlimited access into both Ohio and West Virginia. In order to get a new bridge built, Hiram formed the Clarksburg-Columbus Short Route Bridge Company. The company was responsible for securing the financing, obtaining the State approvals, hiring a bridge designer, and contractors to build the new bridge. J.E. Greiner Company of Baltimore, Maryland, a bridge design engineering company and firm that designed the Silver Bridge at Pt. Pleasant, West Virginia, was hired to draft plans for the construction of the new bridge. The new bridge at St. Marys would be named the \"Short Route Bridge� and was nearly identical to the Silver Bridge. ,  The original design of the Silver Bridge had called for the use of wire cables for the suspension support; however, eyebar members were included as a bid alternate. When the construction bids were received the eyebar members came in at a lower price than the wire cables, and were ultimately chosen for the suspension support. This would be the first time eyebars would be used for the suspension support of a bridge in the United States. The second bridge in the United States to be constructed in this manner would be the Short Route Bridge. ,  In November of 1927 construction began on the Short Route Bridge and was completed on October 25, 1928. The State of West Virginia purchased the bridge in 1937 and removed the toll on it in 1946. On September 16, 1967 the Short Route Bridge was renamed to the \"Hi Carpenter Bridge� in honor of Hiram Carpenter. ,  On the evening of December 15, 1967, the Silver Bridge collapsed killing 46 people. The cause of the collapse was attributed to the failure of one of the eyebars. Further investigations determined the failed eyebar had developed a small crack and grew through internal corrosion, a problem known as stress corrosion cracking. Ultimately, the use of eyebars in the design of the bridge did not provide enough redundancy for the structural support. It was a case of the bridge only being as strong as its weakest link, and in this case, it was the one failed eyebar. ,  Because of the similarity in design and construction with eyebars, the Hi Carpenter Bridge was temporarily closed on December 18, 1967 by the West Virginia Department of Highways and then permanently closed on June 18, 1969. The bridge did not re-open due to the possibility of stress corrosion cracking existing in the Hi Carpenter Bridge, the same corrosion that contributed to the collapse of the Silver Bridge. This type of flaw could not be detected by any inspection method known at that time without disassembly of the eyebar joints. ,  On June 29, 1971 all of the Hi Carpenter Bridge was demolished with the exception of the truss span over the thoroughfare that served as the approach to St. Marys, and the ramp bridge that provides access to Middle Island. In 2017, this truss span was rehabilitated and the ramp bridge was replaced. The revitalized structure continues to provide access to the island below which has become a wildlife refuge, while maintaining a portion of the original bridge design."},{"id":189887,"title":"Reynolds Mound","pos":[39.41884,-81.18499],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=189887","desc":"Reynolds Mound. .  ,  This mound was part of the Adena culture which flourished from about 800 B.C. to 100 A.D.

It was named for William Beauchamp, the first settler in this area. William settled near the Little Kanawha River at Tucker's Riffle in 1796. Beauchamp family members resting in the cemetery include: William Beauchamp, Alfred Beauchamp, Elizabeth Burns Beauchamp, and Elizabeth Woodyard Beauchamp (for whom Elizabeth is named.) Many other early pioneer settlers are also buried there. The Elizabeth Beauchamp Chapter Daughters of American Pioneers provides for the upkeep of the cemetery.,   <b>Early Settlement of Elizabeth</b> ,  William Beauchamp purchased 1400 acres of land and built his cabin and a mill in 1796 at \"Tuckers Riffle� on the Little Kanawha River. In 1803 his son, David, built a water grist mill at the end of Court Street and the expanding settlement became known as Beauchamp's Mill. William Beauchamp was born in 1743 and died in 1808. William was a farmer, minister, and served bravely as a Navy soldier during the American Revolution. He is buried in the family cemetery near Tucker's Creek. William Beauchamp's sons, David and Manlove, also played a vital part of turning the settlement into a town. David purchased five acres of land adjacent the mill site from bis brother, Manlove. The land included the log cabin built by Manlove in 1800. This building, later called the Kanawha Hotel is considered to be the oldest building in this area. David surveyed this land into lots and sold them during the next few years, making the beginnings of a town.,   The General Assembly of Virginia in 1822 made a municipal corporation of the town that was laid off by David Beauchamp and named it \"Elizabeth� for David's wife, The town of Elizabeth in Wood County, Virginia took its place as a town on the map.,   <b>McClung-Morgan House</b> ,  The McClung-Morgan House is located on the historic Court Square In Elizabeth. It is one of Wirt County's early homes built by Dr. Park Walker McClung and his wife, Kate Nuzum McClung. The house features beautiful woodwork and the craftsmanship of builders prior to the Civil War.,   <b>Hotel Kanawha</b> ,  Hidden behind the walls of the Kanawha Hotel is the log cabin overlooking the river that was built in 1800 by Manlove Beauchamp. Visitors can see a portion of the log structure that has been left exposed in the porch area. This hotel contained a dining hall where home-style meals were served and had sleeping rooms with double beds that most of the time was shared by strangers. There was a \"sample room\" in the hotel where the drummers (salesmen) would display their wares. The hotel also operated a livery stable where horse and buggy rentals were available.,   The hotel had gas lights and a long wooden boardwalk on the side that came up from the river. There was a living room for entertainment that provided a space for riverboat passengers to socialize. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.,   <b>Beauchamp-Newman Museum</b> ,  The Beauchamp-Newman Museum, long known as the \"Old Rad Brick\" is the oldest brick building in Elizabeth. Alfred Beauchamp built it in 1835-40. Alfred was the grandson of William Beauchamp, the first settler in this area.,   The General Assembly of Virginia created Wirt County from Wood and Jackson Counties in January of 1848. Naming his hometown of Elizabeth as the county seat honored Alfred Beauchamp. In April and May 1848, the first circuit court and the first county court convened at Beauchamp's home. The first Wirt County Bar was. Instituted and Arthur I. Boreman, first governor of West Virginia, obtained permission to practice in the commonwealth. ,  After Alfred Beauchamp's death, his estate was sold to Alexander Lowther 1872. The dwelling was used as a store and a post office and serve other purposes over the years. In 1953 the Elizabeth Beauchamp Chapter Daughters of American Pioneers purchased the building from the Snodgrass family. They established the Beauchamp-Newman Museum in 1955. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.In 1974.,   <b>Courthouses</b> ,  Wirt County was created by the General Assembly of Virginia on January 19, 1848. It was formed from portions of Wood and Jackson counties. The county was named for William Wirt. Wirt was a distinguished Virginia statesman, lawyer, and author. In May 1848, Colonel Thomas Tavenner conveyed one acre of land to the County of Wirt for the purpose of bulling a courthouse The first story of the court house and jail were made of cut stone and the rest was brick. It served the county until the evening May 15, 1910, when it was destroyed by a fire. Local masons laid the cornerstone for the currant Wirt County Courthouse May 30, 1911. It was designed in a Classical Revival style and built by the Smith Fireproof Construction of Washington, DC courthouse and jail were built and completely furnished for approximately $45,000.

Fort Boreman Historical Park. The Ohio River, called La Belle Riviere (the beautiful river) by the French, derives its name from an Iroquois word meaning \"good river� or \"large river�. The Ohio flows generally along a southwesterly 981-mile course from Pittsburgh, PA, to Cairo, IL, where it empties into the Mississippi River.,   Fort Boreman was constructed during the Civil War on what was then called Mount Logan. The site commanded a stunning view of the river which was vital to riverboat transportation and critical to the war effort. Because of the bend in the river at Parkersburg, no other location in the Mid-Ohio Valley provided such a wide-ranging view. Before the railroad bridge was completed in 1872, railcars of the Northwestern Virginia Railroad and the Marietta-Cincinnati Railroad had to be uncoupled, ferried across the river and reassembled on the other side.,   Across from the confluence of the Ohio and Little Kanawha Rivers lies historic Belpre, OH, the second oldest permanent settlement in the Northwest Territory. Settled in 1789 by members of the Ohio Company of Associates, the town was actually surveyed the year before as Belle Prairie, which is French for \"beautiful meadow.� During the Indian Wars that followed, the earliest settlers lived in a blockhouse known as \"Farmer's Castle.\""},{"id":189928,"title":"Fort Boreman Hill","pos":[39.26179,-81.56899],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=189928","desc":"Fort Boreman Hill. Fort Boreman Historical Park. The prominence known locally as Fort Boreman Hill encompasses almost 250 acres. However, the actual site of Fort Boreman, its gun stations, powder magazine, and winter quarters, utilized only a small portion of the hill.,   The same natural features, panoramic views, and a commanding position above the Ohio and Little Kanawha Rivers that enticed the military to position themselves here during the Civil War also had encouraged early Indians to set up camps on the hill.,   Approximately one-half mile to the east, on a ridge overlooking South Parkersburg, was the site of the \"Pest House�. The City of Parkersburg constructed it in 1867 as a place to quarantine victims of smallpox and other contagious diseases. Locally, the two-story house became known as the \"house of doom,� and many of the patients who died were buried in the nearby pest house cemetery.,   To the left of the entry road, just before reaching the park entrance, is the site of the infamous hangings of 1867. Three men, Daniel Grogan, Thomas Boice, and Mortimer Gibbony, were convicted for the murder of Abram Deem, a well-respected Wood County farmer who was a Confederate sympathizer. Though local lore credits a notorious \"hanging tree� as the gallows, the men were actually hanged from a scaffold.,   In 1893, on a knoll on the western side of Fort Boreman Hill, Gustavus Fries built a public park consisting of tenpin bowling lanes, a dance hall, concession stand, and picnic areas. In addition to a shaded place to relax and enjoy a natural setting, Fries Park offered a venue for musical concerts and even hosted prize fights. The park remained active into the 1940s."},{"id":189957,"title":"American Legion Post No. 21 Veterans Memorial","pos":[38.80315,-81.34952],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=189957","desc":"American Legion Post No. 21 Veterans Memorial. . , In memory of those who gave their lives for their country in time of war"},{"id":189958,"title":"Combat Wounded Veterans Memorial","pos":[38.80314,-81.34959],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=189958","desc":"Combat Wounded Veterans Memorial. .

Surrender by Trickery. <small><i>(preface)</i> Confederate Gen. Albert G. Jenkins led 550 cavalrymen on a 500-mile raid from Salt Sulphur Springs, Aug. 22-Sept. 12, 1862, attacking Federal forces and destroying military stores. He captured and paroled 300 Union soldiers, killed or wounded 1,000 others, destroyed about 5,000 small arms, and seized funds from a U.S. paymaster. At Ravenswood, he forded the Ohio River and raised the Confederate flag in Ohio on Sept. 4. He captured Racine, recrossed the river, and ended the raid at Red House on the Kanawha River.</small>,   On September 1, 1862, Confederate Gen. Albert G. Jenkins and his cavalrymen stopped just east of Spencer, which Union Col. John C. Rathbone and the 11th West Virginia Infantry occupied. The next morning, Jenkins deployed his forces on present-day Alvord and Goff Hills, with the dismounted riders standing between the horses and forming a long line to convince the Federals that they faced an overwhelming force. Jenkins then sent Maj. James W. Sweeney with a flag of truce to demand Rathbone's surrender. 'Rathbone summoned his officers to a council of war and, despite their desire to fight, was inclined to capitulate. He sent Maj. George C. Trimble, later alleged to be a friend of Sweeney, with the Confederate major to confirm the strength of Jenkins's force. After Trimble returned and urged Rathbone to yield, he surrendered without firing a shot.,   Despite being \"surrounded,� however, some Federals easily escaped, and a courier rode to Ravenswood, about forty miles away, without being caught. Jenkins paroled his captives and reported that he \"got some fine arms, which we were compelled to destroy.� The next morning, September 3, the raiders rode on to Ripley. ,   <small><i>(sidebar)</i> In December 1862, after a court of inquiry investigated the surrender, Gen. Jacob D. Cox, commanding the District of West Virginia, declared that \"the whole affair was a burlesque upon military operations, without one redeeming feature. From the receipt of the news of Jenkins' approach in the morning to the receipt of the grossly exaggerated panic-making report of the major in the evening, the reverse of soldierly conduct is proven to have prevailed.� On January 6, 1863, Rathbone and Trimble were, \"by direction of the President, dismissed the service ... for cowardly conduct in surrendering their command.� After the war, however, President Andrew Johnson revoked Rathbone's dismissal and ordered Trimble honorably discharged.</small>,   <i>(captions)</i> ,  Gen.

H. \"Dick\" Stump (who would later become Grantsville's first Mayor) and his wife, Druscilla Ball Stump, built a house, a block from the Courthouse, on Main Street. ,  . The Stumps tuned their home into a hotel by 1885, and in 1897, constructed a two-story, 10-12 room addition on the back, giving the hotel an \"L\" shaped look. ,  . This expansion was necessitated by an increase in population and economic activity in Grantsville, including timbering, oil and gas exploration, the Cabot Carbon Black Factory (largest in the world at the time), and a booming gas boat building industry. Grantsville was a commercial hub in the Little Kanawha Valley. ,  . Following the deaths of Dick and Druscilla, Miss Nettie Stump, their daughter, operated the hotel until 1919. Nettie decided to \"take down her sign\" and the hotel reverted to a private residence. ,  . In the 1930's, the addition was detached, moved to the back of the lot, and turned to face Mill Street where it began a new life as a boarding house. This structure was dismantled in the late 1950's. ,  . In the years following World War II, the Stump home itself was remodeled into offices on both floors and an apartment. The exterior was changed with the addition of shingles, brick porch posts, and an outside stairway. ,  . Eventually the building fell into disuse. ,  . In 1999, through the efforts of Congressman Alan Mollohan and the Vandalia Heritage Foundation, the hotel, the adjacent Quality Shop, and the back of those two properties to Mill Street, were acquired by the Calhoun County Historical Society from Dr. Charles Albert Stump, great-grandson of Dick and Druscilla, to provide the county with a museum. ,  . The first phase was to stabilize and preserve the hotel exterior, including: removing the post-World War II remodeling, putting on a new roof, porch, and siding, and doing foundation work. ,  . In 2015, the Society began the process of restoring the hotel interior, beginning with the kitchen, dining room, and lobby. Society members discovered layers of original wallpaper, 1890's newspapers, muslin wall covering, \"smudging\" of the downstairs ceilings, and wall boards as wide as 15 inches."},{"id":190018,"title":"Job's Temple","pos":[38.93219,-80.96165],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=190018","desc":"Job's Temple. .

Civil War Begins in the Mountains of (West) Virginia.  , West Virginia, born of a nation divided, was the setting for the first campaign of America's Civil War. Although still part of Virginia in 1861, many citizens of the west remained loyal to the Union, rather than the Confederacy. By late May, Union General George B. McClellan, commanding the Department of the Ohio, launched the first campaign, ordering troops to cross the Ohio River and secure \"Western\" Virginia for the Union., Here, during June-July 1861, McClellan's army won the inaugural Union victories of the Civil War. Hailed as the North's first battlefield hero, McClellan was summoned to Washington on July 22, following a stunning Union debacle at Manassas, Virginia. Federal troops now occupied Western Virginia, as loyal delegates met in Wheeling to form the \"Restored Government of Virginia,\" a Union government to oppose the Confederate one in Richmond., By August 1861, Southern forces again threatened. Confederate General Robert E. Lee attempted to reclaim Western Virginia, but failed miserably. Troops of both armies remained to guard the mountain passes during that terrible winter. By 1862, conflict shifted east. The first campaign proved to be decisive: the western counties under Union control became the new state of West Virginia in 1863. The arduous conflict in these mountains forged armies and leaders-notably McClellan, Lee, and Stonewall Jackson-who shaped the course of the Civil War., <i>\"The history of that remarkable campaign would show, if truly portrayed, a degree of severity, of hardship, of toil, of exposure and suffering that finds no parallel.\"</i> , Col.

They filled every building and overflowed into the country round, every inch of space, and yet the cry was for more room.\" Eventually, many of the wounded moved on. For a few, Shepherdstown was their final resting place.,   In 1867, the Southern Soldiers Memorial Association of Shepherdstown was founded \"for the purpose of collecting into a burial ground the bodies of Confederate Soldiers killed during the Civil War and caring for their graves and perpetuating the memory of their heroic deeds.\" In 1868, the group, led by Joseph McMurran, James Madison Hendricks, William L. Arthur, John Will Taylor and John William Benjamin Frazier, purchased \"a piece of land\" from Jacob Line adjacent to the Methodist Cemetery to serve as the final resting place for men who were either killed or died from wounds received during the Maryland Campaign.

The Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) and Deepwater-Tidewater Railway (known as the Virginian after 1907) both wanted to be the first to reach the rich coal deposits of the Slab Fork District. To get there, they had to tunnel through the mountain at Jenny Gap, and began digging competing tunnels just two miles apart from each other.,   Hijinks ensued between the two companies, including acts of sabotage like moving survey stakes and violating right-of-way rules. One of the hottest court cases in Raleigh County history came next. C&O won their case in county circuit court, only to lose when the state supreme court overturned on appeal. The Virginian immediately stopped construction on their tunnel and laid track through the C&O's tunnel, after graciously allowing C&O to remove their tracks.,   Over time, relations between the two rivals grew more friendly, with the Virginian reverting to their original tunnel in 1914.

During his short lifetime, Philip created a special loving relationship with his family ,  special and unique because the bonds transcended what his parents, Barbara and Larry, hoped or dreamed could ever be.,   Energized by the enthusiasm of the Good family, the zoo concept caught on immediately. Thousands of contributions poured in, some in the form of pennies collected by school children. Because of this interest, the original ten-acre site was changed to a thirty-two acre wooded site between Camp Russel and the Wheeling Country Club property. With this change, the Good Zoo grew even before the first spade of dirt was turned.,   In August 1972, Joy and Paul Good, brothers of Philip, presided over the ground-breaking and became the founding members of the Good Zoo Friends with a contribution they had saved over many months from their allowance. IT would be the first zoo in the country to be built from scratch as a natural area. This concept would take time, and the raising of additional funds.

The ban of DDT and the creation of the Endangered Species Act in the early 1970s has led to a dramatic increase in the eagle population.

The C&O provided the key connection for coal mines and sawmills to get their products to market.,   But coal mines, sawmills, and other entrepreneurs were on their own when it came to transporting their products down to the C&O main line. Before the construction of branch rail lines, getting those goods to market could be quite complicated.,   Timbering operations here on the Grandview Plateau in the early 1890s involved hauling or �skidding� the timber by wagon to a circular sawmill at Crow. Milled products were then hauled by horse-drawn tram cars on narrow-gauge rails over to Grandview clifftop, then lowered via monitor to the New River, and finally ferried across the river via �boomboats� to Quinnimont."},{"id":197516,"title":"Glade Creek Timber","pos":[37.76995,-81.06883],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=197516","desc":"Glade Creek Timber. .  ,  As logging in the New River Gorge expanded, timber operations gradually became more efficient. Local timber company J. R. Beaty and Company created the first railroad in Raleigh County, the Glade Creek and Raleigh (GC&R) Railroad, in 1895. The GC&R built a 15-mile narrow-gauge route from the New River up Glade Creek gorge via switchbacks to the Grandview plateau, through a newly-dug tunnel at Crow Ridge, to its western terminus at Raleigh (near Beckley).,   When timber stands in one area were logged out, other areas had to be exploited, leading to changing railroad routes. The Crow Ridge tunnel route was closed in 1904 when a new southeastern rail route was installed to access timber stands on upper Glade Creek. The tunnel was sealed shortly thereafter, but trackage remained in the area until the Crow sawmill closed in 1910.,   The new Glade Creek Coal and Lumber Company (GCC&L) made a major investment in this area in 1921 when they built a standard gauge rail line up Glade Creek, which extended nearly to White Oak Mountain.

Logging practices of the time meant that �boom� towns like Glade and Hamlet went �bust,� and old rail lines were abandoned. The Hamlet sawmill closed in 1936, and the metal girders atop the Glade-Hamlet bridge were recycled by the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) at other bridges along its routes.,   New River Gorge National River, a unit of the National Park Service, today protects over 72,000 acres of Appalachian forest, including the remains of Hamlet and Glade.

When the iron is white hot, it is placed on an anvil, where it is hammered into the desired shape.,   The blacksmith shop at Jackson's Mill would have served many families in this rural community., "},{"id":197619,"title":"Jackson's Mill","pos":[39.0963,-80.46624],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=197619","desc":"Jackson's Mill. .  ,  Edward Jackson, \"Stonewall's\" grandfather, came to the West Fork valley with his family in 1801 and built a log gristmill at a bend on the east side of the West Fork River sometime within the next few years. Milling was an important industry in the frontier economy, and Edward's mill was very successful. When his son Cummins took possession after Edward's death in 1828, he acquired the best part of his father's legacy.,   Cummins Jackson had learned the milling trade well. Recognizing that the West Fork's powerful current threatened to destroy his inheritance, he rebuilt the mill on the river's west bank, the inside of the bend. He retained only the machinery and foundation timber of Edward's mill. The new mill was constructed of a combination of hand-hewn timber and boards produced at the sawmill. Unfortunately, the new mill burned within a few years. Undaunted, Cummins rebuilt the mill you see today on the same site in 1841. This mill was built on a foundation of native stone.

Civil War Begins in the Mountains of (West) Virginia.  , West Virginia, born of a nation divided, was the setting for the first campaign of America�s Civil War. Although still part of Virginia in 1861, many citizens of the west remained loyal to the Union, rather than the Confederacy. By late May, Union General George B. McClellan, commanding the Department of the Ohio, launched the first campaign, ordering troops to cross the Ohio River and secure �Western� Virginia for the Union.,   Here, during June-July 1861, McClellan�s army won the inaugural Union victories of the Civil War. Hailed as the North�s first battlefield hero, McClellan was summoned to Washington on July 22, following a stunning Union debacle at Manassas, Virginia. Federal troops now occupied Western Virginia, as loyal delegates met in Wheeling to form the �Restored Government of Virginia,� a Union government to oppose the Confederate one in Richmond.,   By August 1861, Southern forces again threatened. Confederate General Robert E. Lee attempted to reclaim Western Virginia, but failed miserably. Troops of both armies remained to guard the mountain passes during that terrible winter. By 1862, conflict shifted east. The first campaign proved to be decisive: the western counties under Union control became the state of West Virginia in 1863. The arduous conflict in these mountains forged armies and leaders-notably McClellan, Lee, and Stonewall Jackson-who shaped the course of the Civil War.,   <i>�The history of that remarkable campaign would show, if truly portrayed, a degree of severity, of hardship, of tail, of exposure and suffering that finds no parallel.�</i> ,  Col.

Gaut) is a short-barreled, large-caliber cannon designed to throw shells at a higher trajectory than regular field guns. This makes them useful against enemy troops behind fortifications or concealed in rugged terrain. The mountain howitzer was a special gun, designed on such a small scale that the entire piece could be taken apart and carried on pack animals. Although its 4.62-inch bore could handle the same 12-pounder ammunition as regular 12-pounder gun, a complete mountain howitzer, including the carriage, wheels and barrel, weighed less than the barrel alone of a larger 12-pounder field gun., Mountain howitzers generally fired spherical case shot, canister or grapeshot. All of these types of ammunition, which scattered small shot and shell fragments, were effective within the shortened range of the mountain howitzer. Case shot for mountain howitzers carried a load of 82 lead musket balls. The shell was exploded above enemy positions by a fuse. Case shot was usually fired at enemy positions several hundred yards away. Canister consisted of tin-plated iron cylinders loaded with round shot packed in sawdust. Most Civil War canister contained iron shot, but canister rounds for the mountain howitzer were crammed with a load of 148 .69-caliber lead musket balls. Fuses were not needed for canister. A round of canister burst when the cannon was fired, blasting its load of musket balls out of the muzzle as if fired from a tremendous sawed-off shotgun. Canister was used from distances of about 400 yards to point-blank range. The load of lead from a round of canister made a little mountain howitzer as deadly as any other cannon at close range., Because mules were nearly always used to carry mountain howitzers by packsaddle, companies with these little guns were sometimes called \"jackass batteries.\" If the terrain permitted, the mountain howitzer could be mounted on its carriage and drawn by means of a pair of shafts by one of the mules. A few units did away with the packsaddles altogether and used a pair of horses to draw the gun., <small>This article was excerpted from: Norris, David A. \"Confederate Gunners Affectionately Called Their Hard Working Little Mountain Howitzers 'Bull Pups'.\" (<i>America's Civil War</i>, September 1995), 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 90</small>"},{"id":198733,"title":"Lest We Forget!","pos":[39.46861,-79.68168],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=198733","desc":"\"Lest We Forget!\". .  ,  This monument is dedicated to all Prestonians who served their country honorably in the Armed Forces of the United States of America..

Most bridges were soon repaired. Confederate losses were slight. By May 26, both commands had returned to Virginia's Shenandoah Valley.</small>,   On April 26, 1863, as Confederate Gen. William E. Jones's cavalrymen approached Rowlesburg from Grant County, Union Maj. John Showalter's small garrison had to defend two routes into town. Jones had divided his troops and was attacking the road where you stand now, as well as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Cheat River bridge. Were either to succeed, the rail line to the Ohio River would be cut.,   Just ahead on the River Road (present-day State Route 72), Jones sent 300 of his men to break through the perimeter defenses. By 2 P.M., they were less than a mile from town, just beyond a point known as The Cliffs, where Showalter's men had thrown up a barricade of logs. As the Confederate cavalry approached, the Union rifle men fired, and Jones's men fell back. The Confederates dismounted and attacked with carbines, but again came under heavy fire and retreated. They were unable to outflank the Federals, now reinforced by citizens from town.,   The fighting here raged \"at intervals from 3 P.M. until dark.\" Jones personally commanded the last assault, but after seeing that his troops stalemated, he ordered them to hold their position until dusk then pull back to the turnpike. From here, Jones moved on to Morgantown and then to Fairmont.,   <small><i>(captions)</i> ,  Gen. William E.

April 26, 1863. <center><b>Cheat Bridges Become Target</b>. Since 1861, a special target for destruction by order of both President Jefferson Davis and Commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee, Rowlesburg was the only town or outpost in western Virginia that was a principle target of the raid to stand up to the Confederate onslaught and emerge unscathed., After arriving in Grafton on June 23, 1861 General George McClellan decided to establish a strong position at Philippi and protect his line of supply, the B&O. McClellan, who had served as chief engineer for the Illinois Central Railroad and was intimately familiar with the B&O, assigned forty-eight companies to guard it. To protect the costly Cheat River Bridge and viaducts he posted an entire regiment, the 1st Virginia Infantry, fresh from its victory at Philippi, at Rowlesburg, after visiting the isolated town in person., Fearing that McClellan would augment his force along the B&O in Northern Virginia, and then use the rail line to advance to Harpers Ferry in support of an invasion of eastern Virginia, Confederates, led by General Robert E. Lee made plans to cut the B&O. They resolved to demolish the B&Os viaducts and bridge at Rowlesburg along the Cheat River. Realizing that no other point on the B&O offered such a high density of targets, and that rebuilding these remarkable structures would entail considerable time and expense, Lee wrote: \"The rupture of the railroad at Cheat River would be worth to us an army.\", Under McClellan's orders, General Charles E. Hill's Union forces prepared their defensive positions at and near Rowlesburg., Colonel James Irvine was assigned the duty of protecting the railroad bridge and trestles at Rowlesburg, as well as the Northwestern Turnpike Bridge four miles up the Cheat River. Irvine established his headquarters at the turnpike bridge, which was protected by an advance guard of two companies under Captain Donlon and Captain Chapman. These troops, some two hundred men, built breast works and quartered on this covered bridge. A telegraph line linked Irwin's advance position to the main force at Rowlesburg. , On July 3, 1861 General Hill and staff, accompanied by Captian I.M. Pumphrey, Quartermaster of the 1st Virginia, made a tour of inspection of the Rowlesburg positions. Informing readers of this inspection tour, a <i>Wheeling Intelligencer</i> reporter noted that \"everything is working admirably about Cheat River.\" The reporter considered General Hill \"a shrewd, able and most accomplished commander... no ordinary man.\" Believing that Confederate forces would soon attack Rowlesburg, the reporter added: \"It is a great pity that the other Virginia companies yet behind on the line of the B&O RR are not with them (the Rowlesburg Force), as there is good reason to believe that the force in that quarter may have an opportunity of covering themselves with glory.\", <small>\"Worth to us an Army...\" Rowlesburg and Cannon Hill are in the Civil War, Historical Research Project.

Excerpted by Timothy Weaver, Professor Emeritus, Boston University.</small>, <center><b>Establishing a Defense of the B&O Hills Headquarters</b>. \"Rowlesburg, the headquaters of General Hill in Western Virginia, is situated in a deep gorge in the Alleghenies, at a point where the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad crosses Cheat River. The scenery around it is bold, grand, and picturesque, shut in by towering mountain-walls, the dark stream flows silently on, overshadowed with dense forests of hemlock and laurel. This region of country is wild and thinly populated, and deer and bear roam unmolested along the thickly-wooded slopes. The little village has sprung up since the opening of the railroad, and has become quite a thriving place. General Hill is at present concentrating all his troops at Rowlesburg, by order of General McClellan, for the purpose of cutting off the retreat of the Confederates lately under Garnett, at St. George. The illustration will be found on page 490.\", <small>The bridge, which was a composite (wood and iron through-truss designed by Fink, is depicted somewhat inaccurately by the artist since it shows the sides covered, as well as the roof, and does not include the wrought iron laterals. See <i>Workman</i>, May 2005.)</small>, <center><b>Jones Elects Two-prong Attack</b>. On March 28, 1863 Jefferson Davis sent a letter to R.E. Lee suggesting that \"now is the time to destroy ... the Cheat River Bridge, if possible.\" Finally, on April 20, after delays due to heavy rain, J.D. Imboden left his base on Shenandoah Mountain with an army of 3,300, chiefly infantry, and pressed forward on the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike to Beverly, which they reached on April 24. Meanwhile, W.E. \"Grumble\" Jones departed from Brocks Gap on April 21, 1863., Jones' force crossed the [West] Virginia line in the morning of April 26, some stopping at the Red House Tavern for a griddlecake breakfast. At nearby West Union (Aurora) the confederates stole food and clothing from David Ridenour's store and took hostages to question and act as guides through the unfamiliar country. Reaching the bottom of the grade, about one mile east of the Cheat River turnpike bridge, Jones halted to give orders for the attack. Jones later wrote in his report that he ordered Green \"not to be stopped by a mere inferior infantry picket, which was posted about a mile above the town, but to charge by and leave these men to the care of the regiments in his rear. If a heavy force awaited him in the bluff above the road along the river, then to dislodge them with sharpshooters.\", Meanwhile, Jones moved his column to the east side of the turnpike bridge and halted. Here, near the mouth of Madison Run, he sent two hundred dismounted troopers up over a steep mountain called Palmer's Knob (now known as Lantz Ridge), a distance of a miles and a half, to strike the east end of the railway bridge at Rowlesburg. The purpose of this attack was to divert the attention of the Rowlesburg defenders, so that Green and his troopers could sweep into the town along the turnpike and overrun the garrison. According to Jones' report of the attack, Captain Weems, of the Eleventh Virginia Cavalry with 80 sharpshooters of his regiment and part of Witcher's battalion, was sent across the hills from the bridge on the northwest grade to attack the east end of the railroad bridge at Rowlesburg, and to fire it at all hazards., <center><b>Jones' Attack Fails</b>. In the meantime, Major Showalter was disposing his troops for defense of the town and railroad. He sent a small attachment to guard the Tray Run and Buckeye Run viaducts, and established a defensive line along the north side of the railroad embankment from the railway bridge to the River Hotel in town. Some crossties were hastily piled-up on the railroad track, and this, along with the embankment, formed a defense for his men., Citizens of the town armed with a variety of weapons joined the soldiers. Showalter also sent a detachment of about 20 men under Sergeant Gallion of Company F and Lieutenant McDonald of Company L to guard the St. George pike, where Col. Green's detachment was approaching. This force took a position in some rifle pits on a steep hill overlooking the river road where it narrowed about one mile outside of town., Weem's Rebel detachment was seen forming on Palmer's Knob, across the river, east of town. They took positions about half way down the mountain on a bench, where they formed a line and moved forward. According to the eyewitness account of Purinton, at around two-thirty, the troopers \"came bounding and bellowing down the mountain, yelling like fiends just up from the pit.\" Concealed behind the railroad embankment, Showalter's force of soldiers, armed with Enfield rifled muskets, and townspeople allowed the Confederates to come within \"easy rifle range,\" then opened with devastating fire., According to other accounts, Weems's force was also fired upon by a force of \"sharpshooters\" and \"townsfolk,\" as well as by cannon, from Cannon Hill and positions on the east side of the river. The rebels replied with a volley of their own. Then, a \"constant and well-directed fire was opened up on them from the town, and in half an hour not a rebel was to be seen.\" The Confederate force was in full retreat along the side of the mountain, headed south to gain the lines of the Green's column across the river. Weems's attack had failed., Meanwhile, the more desperate fight on the river road was raging. According to Purinton, it continued \"at intervals from 3 p.m. until dark....\" From their strong position overlooking the river road, McDonald's force fired on Jones's scouting party, who fell back to the turnpike intersection to report to Jones. Jones ordered Col. Green's 6th Virginia forward. It moved out cautiously toward the town. As the Confederates came to a narrow place in the road, about one mile south of town, McDonald ordered his riflemen to fire. , Rather than charging past the enemy as Jones had commanded, Green ordered his men to fall back, then sent for Jones. This decision would infuriate Gen. Jones and lead to the court-martial of Green that September. Private John Opie, one of Green's troopers, would later testify that Green's decision to halt was wise: \"Had we charged, we certainly could not have reached the men in the rifle pits; but, on the other hand, would have been exposed to a heavy flank fire from them.\", Col. Green then made another attempt to outflank McDonald's strong position. Receiving reinforcements from the 7th and 11th he sent troopers to cross the river. According to Wiley, \"an effort was next made by the Confederates to cross the river, ... but so hot and well directed a fire was poured upon the adventurous party in the river, that they were glad to retreat to the shore.\" Nothing could be done to dislodge the force from its impregnable line. An enraged Jones arrived during this last assault and, after seeing that his troops were stalemated, ordered Green to hold his position until dusk and then pull back to the turnpike., The battle of Rowlesburg was over. Lincoln's Lifeline was saved."},{"id":198774,"title":"Rowlesburg Area Honor Roll","pos":[39.34784,-79.66927],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=198774","desc":"Rowlesburg Area Honor Roll. .

By May 26, both commands had returned to Virginia's Shenandoah Valley.</small>,   From where you stand, looking across Salt Lick Creek and the rail yard, down past the shop buildings, you can see the railroad bridge crossing. One mile beyond is the Tray Run Viaduct. During the Civil War, these bridges were critical to both sides. Destroying them would cut the rail line at a point where there was no alternative route west.,   On Sunday, April 26, 1863, Confederate Gen. William E. Jones sent a hundred dismounted troopers marching from the Northwestern Turnpike covered bridge (four miles upstream) up over a steep mountain called Palmer's Knob. They were to capture the eastern end of the railroad bridge and to \"fire it at all hazard.\",   Local resident John Wheeler spotted the detachment forming on Palmer's Knob, across the river, east of town. He ran over the railroad bridge, burst into the meetinghouse, and announced that the Confederates were coming. The congregation rushed out to help Union Maj. John Showalter's small garrison defend the bridge.,   Jones's men formed a line about halfway down the mountain on a \"bench\" (level area seen above the bridge), moved forward, and \"came bounding and bellowing down the mountain, yelling like fiends just up from the pit,\" according to a witness. Protected by the railroad embankment and armed with Enfield rifled muskets, the Federals and towns people opened fire. Other sharpshooters and townspeople, as well as guns on Cannon Hill just behind you, also fired. The Confederates responded but after half an hour retreated, leaving the bridge untouched.

When fire destroyed the Preston County Courthouse in 1869, Circuit Court of Preston County was held in the Preston Academy until the new courthouse was built in 1870. In 1959, the Preston County Board of Education purchased the property for use as classes and offices until the late-1980's. In 1996, Friends of the Preston Academy was formed to preserve the building and grounds to provide cultural and educational opportunities.,   The Preston Academy, significant as a fine example of Second Empire architectural style and the third oldest building in Kingwood, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.,   Founding trustees of the Preston Academy were among the most illustrious men in the county. Two notable \"masters\" put their intellectual and moral stamp on the institution - Alexander Martin and William Conley. Major Conley was director of the Academy for 14 years. His son, William, served as West Virginia's eighteenth governor. Alexander Martin directed the Academy in 1846-1847. In 1867, he was named president of newly-founded West Virginia University. For his influence there, he often is considered its \"founder.\" Martin's influence on the Preston Academy can be seen in its balanced curriculum and the strict standards of student behavior set by the by-laws.,   In 1874, the Preston Academy had fallen into disrepair; the Board of Education ordered construction of a new schoolhouse near the town cemetery to be known as the Kingwood Academy. The last day at the Preston Academy was to be celebrated by a picnic in July 1875. Since it was rainy, the Preston County Journal reports that the celebration was held indoors. A visitor and teachers \"supplied a quantity of confections and the little folks, having brought their baskets filled with delicacies, a dinner was spread in the Academy...Shrieks of merriment, smiles and all the innocent playfulness, which happy childhood only knows\" marked the end of over three decades of education at the Preston Academy.,   Nearly one hundred years later, the voice of beloved commercial teacher Mary Virginia Fairfax rang out in these halls.

Just across the bridge on the opposite side of the railroad yard a handful of determined Union troops behind a barricade of crossties routed a forward column of Confederate Raiders. The Confederate soldiers would retreat without laying a finger on their target: the railroad bridge crossing Cheat River.,   Though small in scale compared to Gettysburg and Antietam, the struggle to control the B&O Railroad was pivotal in Lincoln's war plan. On April 26, 1863, a force of 1500 Confederates attacked Rowlesburg and tried to destroy the two key bridges crossing Cheat Valley. Had they been successful, the link between the Army of the Potomac and the Volunteers of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois would have been cut for perhaps the duration of the war.,   Looking west past the railroad shop buildings, you can see the railroad bridge crossing Cheat River. One mile beyond is the Tray Run Viaduct. At the time of the Civil War, these bridges were critical in carrying troops and supplies. Destroying these bridges was a high value target because it would have cut the rail line at point where there were no alternative routes west.,   Not only were the B&O Railroad bridges in Rowlesburg famous around the world and an inspiration to writers and artists, but they also came early to the attention of those planning the Confederate strategy in the War Between the States. As the Confederates planned to destroy the Rowlesburg bridges, the Federals hurried to protect them. Robert E. Lee would say that to destroy the Cheat River Bridge would be worth to him an army. To the Federal side preserving \"Lincoln's Lifeline\" was of equal importance.,   To help defend the railroad bridges in Rowlesburg, General George McClellan ordered the Sixteenth Ohio Regiment to be sent by train to reinforce troops. This was the beginning of the buildup of the Rowlesburg garrison and recognition of the strategic importance of the little river town in the Civil War. Historian Mike Workman completed a definitive study of Rowlesburg in the Civil War. The account that follows of the attack on Rowlesburg is based upon Dr. Workman's study.,   April 26, 1863,   After the initial threat posed by General Garrett's unsuccessful move toward Rowlesburg in 1861, the Rowlesburg garrison was gradually reduced to about 300 men under the command of Major John Showalter. Confederate General, W. E. Jones, who was known by the nickname of \"Grumble\" for his irascible temper and profanity-laced tirades, would lead the 1500 Confederate cavalry, known as \"Jones' Raiders.\" On <b>April 26, 1863</b>, General Jones and his cavalry rode from Red House, Maryland to the foot of Cheat Mountain on the old Northwestern Turnpike, now US 50. Jones' party was the northern prong of the famous Jones-Imboden Raid. Just the day before they had defeated a garrison of Union troops defending the passage through Greenleaf Gap.,   From his position up river about four miles Jones sent Col. Green to attack defenses along the river road coming into Rowlesburg. Jones also sent an additional one hundred dismounted troopers up over a steep mountain called Palmer's Knob to strike the east end of the railway bridge at Rowlesburg under the command of Captain Weems. According to Jones' report of the attack, Weems was to attack the east end of the railroad bridge at Rowlesburg, and to \"fire it at all hazard.\",   At two o'clock shots were heard from the direction of the river road, where Green's forces were driving in the pickets. Meanwhile, Weem's detachment was seen forming on Palmer's Knob, across the river, east of town. They took positions about half way down the mountain on a \"bench\" (level area seen across the bridge), where they formed a line and moved forward. According to an eyewitness account, at around two-thirty, the troopers \"came bounding and bellowing down the mountain, yelling like fiends just up from the pit.\" Concealed behind the railroad embankment and armed with Enfield rifled muskets, soldiers and townspeople allowed the Confederates to come within \"easy rifle range,\" then opened with devastating fire.,   According to other accounts, Weems's men were also fired upon by a force of \"sharpshooters\" and \"townsfolk,\" and by cannons from Cannon Hill (just behind you and straight up 600 feet above the valley). The rebels replied with a volley of their own. Then, a \"constant and well-directed fire was opened up on them from the town, and in half an hour not a rebel was to be seen.\" The Confederate force was in full retreat. Weems's attack on the railroad bridge crossing Cheat River had failed utterly.,   Fragments of Parrot Gun shells have been found on the hillside around Palmers Knob where the Confederates grouped for their charge toward the bridge. On the peak across the CSX Railroad yard and just north of town is the famous Cannon Hill. Cannon balls have been found for years on the hill and in town. Records show that cannons were pulled to the top of the hill by oxen. It is assumed these guns were involved in defending the bridge. Perhaps howitzers were also used at close range along the barricade of crossties thrown up by the defenders. Military records show that howitzers were present in Rowlesburg. If cannons were used in the battle for the bridge, it would explain why the Confederates retreated without getting to the bridge.,   A special target for destruction by order of both Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, and Commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee, Rowlesburg was the only town or outpost in western Virginia that was a principal target of the raid to stand up to the Confederate onslaught and emerge unscathed. \"Lincoln's Lifeline\" was preserved."},{"id":199044,"title":"Veterans Memorial","pos":[39.3948,-79.74624],"url":"http://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=199044","desc":"Veterans Memorial. .

When the 1852 structure was built it was the largest viaduct in the world. The stone structure shown below was built in 1907 to replace a wrought iron structure. The first structure was a cast iron bridge and was replaced in 1887. The bridge was a major target for the Confederate Army during the Civil War.

April 26, 1863.  ,  <b>Hills Headquarters</b> ,  \"Rowlesburg, the headquaters of General Hill in Western Virginia, is situated in a deep gorge in the Alleghenies, at a point where the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad crosses Cheat River. The scenery around it is bold, grand, and picturesque, shut in by towering mountain-walls, the dark stream flows silently on, overshadowed with dense forests of hemlock and laurel. This region of country is wild and thinly populated, and deer and bear roam unmolested along the thickly-wooded slopes. The little village has sprung up since the opening of the railroad, and has become quite a thriving place. General Hill is at present concentrating all his troops at Rowlesburg, by order of General McClellan, for the purpose of cutting off the retreat of the Confederates lately under Garnett, at St. George. The illustration will be found on page 490.\",   <small>The bridge, which was a composite (wood and iron through-truss designed by Fink, is depicted somewhat inaccurately by the artist since it shows the sides covered, as well as the roof, and does not include the wrought iron laterals. <i>See Workman, May 2005.</i>)</small>,   <center><b>Jones Elects Two-prong Attack</b>.  On March 28, 1863 Jefferson Davis sent a letter to R.E. Lee suggesting that \"now is the time to destroy � the Cheat River Bridge, if possible.\" Finally, on April 20, after delays due to heavy rain, J.D. Imboden left his base on Shenandoah Mountain with an army of 3,300, chiefly infantry, and pressed forward on the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike to Beverly, which they reached on April 24. Meanwhile, W.E. \"Grumble\" Jones departed from Brocks Gap on April 21, 1863.,   Jones' force crossed the [West] Virginia line in the morning of April 26, some stopping at the Red House Tavern for a griddlecake breakfast. At nearby West Union (Aurora) the confederates stole food and clothing from David Ridenour's store and took hostages to question and act as guides through the unfamiliar country. Reaching the bottom of the grade, about one mile east of the Cheat River turnpike bridge, Jones halted to give orders for the attack. Jones later wrote in his report that he ordered Green \"not to be stopped by a mere inferior infantry picket, which was posted about a mile above the town, but to charge by and leave these men to the care of the regiments in his rear. If a heavy force awaited him in the bluff above the road along the river, then to dislodge them with sharpshooters.\",   Meanwhile, Jones moved his column to the east side of the turnpike bridge and halted. Here, near the mouth of Madison Run, he sent two hundred dismounted troopers up over a steep mountain called Palmer's Knob (now known as Lantz Ridge), a distance of a miles and a half, to strike the east end of the railway bridge at Rowlesburg. The purpose of this attack was to divert the attention of the Rowlesburg defenders, so that Green and his troopers could sweep into the town along the turnpike and overrun the garrison. According to Jones' report of the attack, Captain Weems, of the Eleventh Virginia Cavalry with 80 sharpshooters of his regiment and part of Witcher's battalion, was sent across the hills from the bridge on the northwest grade to attack the east end of the railroad bridge at Rowlesburg, and to fire it at all hazards.,   <center><b>Cheat Bridges Become Target</b>.  ,   Since 1861, a special target for destruction by order of both President Jefferson Davis and Commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee, Rowlesburg was the only town or outpost in western Virginia that was a principle target of the raid to stand up to the Confederate onslaught and emerge unscathed.,   After arriving in Grafton on June 23, 1861 General George McClellan decided to establish a strong position at Philippi and protect his line of supply, the B&O. McClellan, who had served as chief engineer for the Illinois Central Railroad and was intimately familiar with the B&O, assigned forty-eight companies to guard it. To protect the costly Cheat River Bridge and viaducts he posted an entire regiment, the 1st Virginia Infantry, fresh from its victory at Philippi, at Rowlesburg, after visiting the isolated town in person.,   Fearing that McClellan would augment his force along the B&O in Northern Virginia, and then use the rail line to advance to Harpers Ferry in support of an invasion of eastern Virginia, Confederates, led by General Robert E. Lee made plans to cut the B&O. They resolved to demolish the B&Os viaducts and bridge at Rowlesburg along the Cheat River. Realizing that no other point on the B&O offered such a high density of targets, and that rebuilding these remarkable structures would entail considerable time and expense, Lee wrote: \"The rupture of the railroad at Cheat River would be worth to us an army.\",   Under McClellan's orders, General Charles E. Hill's Union forces prepared their defensive positions at and near Rowlesburg.,   Colonel James Irvine was assigned the duty of protecting the railroad bridge and trestles at Rowlesburg, as well as the NorthwesternTurnpike Bridge four miles up the Cheat River. Irvine established his headquarters at the turnpike bridge, which was protected by an advance guard of two companies under Captain Donlon and Captain Chapman. These troops, some two hundred men, built breast works and quartered on this covered bridge. A telegraph line linked Irwin's advance position to the main force in Rowlesburg.,   On July 3, 1861 General Hill and staff, accompanied by Captain I.M. Pumphrey, Quartermaster of the 1st Virginia, made a tour of inspection of the Rowlesburg positions. Informing readers of this inspection tour, a <i>Wheeling Intelligencer</i> reporter noted that \"everything is working admirably about Cheat River.\" The reporter considered General Hill \"a shrewd, able and most accomplished commander� no ordinary man\" Believing that Confederate forces would soon attack Rowlesburg, the reporter added: \"It is a great pity that the other Virginia companies yet behind on the line of the B&O RR are not with them (the Rowlesburg Force), as there is good reason to believe that the force in that quarter may have an opportunity of covering themselves with glory.\",   <small><b>\"Worth to us an Army�\"</b> Rowlesburg and Cannon Hill in the Civil War, Historical Research Project.

Excerpted by Timothy Weaver, Professor Emeritus, Boston University.</small>,   <center><b>Jones' Attack Fails</b>.  ,   In the meantime, Major Showalter was disposing his troops for defense of the town and railroad. He sent a small attachment to guard the Tray Run and Buckeye Run viaducts, and established a defensive line along the north side of the railroad embankment from the railway bridge to the River Hotel in town. Some crossties were hastily piled-up on the railroad track, and this, along with the embankment, formed a defense for his men.,   Citizens of the town armed with a variety of weapons joined the soldiers. Showalter also sent a detachment of about 20 men under Sergeant Gallion of Company F and Lieutenant McDonald of Company L to guard the St. George pike, where Col. Green's detachment was approaching. This force took a position in some rifle pits on a steep hill overlooking the river road where it narrowed about one mile outside of town.,   Weem's Rebel detachment was seen forming on Palmer's Knob, across the river, east of town. They took positions about half way down the mountain on a bench, where they formed a line and moved forward. According to the eyewitness account of Purinton, at around two-thirty, the troopers \"came bounding and bellowing down the mountain, yelling like fiends just up from the pit.\" Concealed behind the railroad embankment, Showalter's force of soldiers, armed with Enfield rifled muskets, and townspeople allowed the Confederates to come within \"easy rifle range,\" then opened with devastating fire.,   According to other accounts, Weems's force was also fired upon by a force of \"sharpshooters\" and \"townsfolk,\" as well as by cannon, from Cannon Hill and positions on the east side of the river. The rebels replied with a volley of their own. Then, a \"constant and well-directed fire was opened up on them from the town, and in half an hour not a rebel was to be seen.\" The Confederate force was in full retreat along the side of the mountain, headed south to gain the lines of the Green's column across the river. Weems's attack had failed.,   Meanwhile, the more desperate fight on the river road was raging. According to Purinton, it continued \"at intervals from 3 p.m. until dark....\" From their strong position overlooking the river road, McDonald's force fired on Jones's scouting party, who fell back to the turnpike intersection to report to Jones. Jones ordered Col. Green's 6th Virginia forward. It moved out cautiously toward the town. As the Confederates came to a narrow place in the road, about one mile south of town, McDonald ordered his riflemen to fire. ,   Rather than charging past the enemy as Jones had commanded, Green ordered his men to fall back, then sent for Jones. This decision would infuriate Gen. Jones and lead to the court-martial of Green that September. Private John Opie, one of Green's troopers, would later testify that Green's decision to halt was wise: \"Had we charged, we certainly could not have reached the men in the rifle pits; but, on the other hand, would have been exposed to a heavy flank fire from them.\",   Col. Green then made another attempt to outflank McDonald's strong position. Receiving reinforcements from the 7th and 11th he sent troopers to cross the river. According to Wiley, \"an effort was next made by the Confederates to cross the river, � but so hot and well directed a fire was poured upon the adventurous party in the river, that they were glad to retreat to the shore.\" Nothing could be done to dislodge the force from its impregnable line. An enraged Jones arrived during this last assault and, after seeing that his troops were stalemated, ordered Green to hold his position until dusk and then pull back to the turnpike.,   The battle of Rowlesburg was over. Lincoln's Lifeline was saved."}]
